The west-facing Temple is built on a rectangular base and has a&nbsp;phalcā&nbsp;like structure, i.e. its three sides are open and twenty wooden columns support its roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very likely that this monument was previously a&nbsp;phalcā&nbsp;and later converted into a temple. Although the reason(s) behind such a conversion is not clear, it shows how the original structure and usages of cultural heritage sites change in due course of time. This sets a good example for why (in)tangible heritage should be preserved physically and digitally. Without proper documentation, the historical origins and transformations of such monument sites will remain unrecorded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address these issues, since 2018, the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nepal Heritage Preservation Project</a>&nbsp;is focusing on &lsquo;digital preservation&rsquo; of the cultural heritage of the Kathmandu Valley and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Vajra Gaṇeśa Mandira, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/154297b7-c1ca-4eca-813e-774c28a7f805" target="_blank">DANAM</a>&nbsp;database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-07-01	p

The Sataḥ partly collapsed in the 2015 earthquakes and its superstructure was dismantled shortly thereafter. Today only remnants of the foundation plinth and a few carved base stones representing lions remain on the overgrown site. The salvaged wood elements of the Sataḥ, which include columns, capitals and window frames, are stored in a metal shed nearby. The earliest images&nbsp;of the rest house taken by Werner Jacobsen in the 1950s show the building in its original configuration: Four carvings of Garuḍa can be seen attached to the centers of the capitals and nine carved wooden statues of unidentified deities are installed on the front face of the main beam. By 2014 all these statues had disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historic trade route linking Kathmandu with Tibet used to cross through Sankhu. Horse caravans laden with goods often stopped there for an overnight stay. The traders were allowed to use the Dhũllā Sataḥ for accommodation and the horses were tied to large stones in front of the Sataḥ. Such stones with holes in them can still be seen there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;guthi&nbsp;related to the Dhũllā Sataḥ is still in operation. The members of the Guthi claim that their ancestor, Jaya Śaṅkara, built the Sataḥ some 400 years ago. There is no other information available regarding Dhũllā Sataḥ&#39;s age but the patterns and designs of woodcarvings also suggest a construction date in the late 17th century. Jaya Śaṅkara belonged to the influential Mehera Śreṣṭha clan that was responsible for the construction of many monuments in Sankhu. A record book of 1916 states the Guthi&#39;s responsibility for taking care of the Dhũllā Sataḥ and renovating it when required. Elders recall a portion of the Sataḥ&rsquo;s roof collapsing in the 1934 earthquake. At that time Guthi members managed to carry out repairs within only a few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those days the Guthi received income from landholdings that made regular repairs and maintenance of the building possible. However, since this land is no longer under the Guthi&#39;s ownership it has been become difficult to raise the necessary funds. The failure in arranging a regular income for the timely maintenance of the Sataḥ coupled with most of the Guthi members moving out of Sankhu had left the rest house in a state of disrepair. Around 2010 a portion of the roof collapsed and parts of the central window fell off. It wasn&#39;t till mid-2012 that the Guthi covered the damaged portion of the roof with corrugated metal sheets, but unfortunately, the windows were never repaired. Despite the Sataḥ&#39;s importance and high artistic value no more efforts went into maintenance and its condition deteriorated further, resulting finally in its collapse. Following the dismantling of the Sataḥ in 2015, the Department of Archaeology initiated the administrative process for the reconstruction. However, this effort was abandoned due to a dispute over the Sataḥ&rsquo;s ownership. Because the Sataḥ was never put in proper public ownership, now private individuals are claiming ownership so that they can use the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Dhũllā Sataḥ, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/08e7bdc5-3bfd-43d1-915f-85b53472093b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DANAM&nbsp;</a>database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2022-01-01	p

The fa&ccedil;ade is decorated with a clay relief featuring a line of marching soldiers with guns resting on their shoulders. The building owes its popular name &quot;platoon house&quot; to this relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The symmetrical facade features a three-bay opening in the center and is flanked by two doors on either side. The central opening likely once had the same carved wooden arches that survive on the side doors but might have been removed to fit the new doors for the shops. The relief of marching soldiers covers the entire width of the building. Similar figures of armed soldiers, carved on a timber corniche, have been documented at the Gārada Ghara in Nuwakot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first floor is divided by pillars into seven bays. The design of the pillars has its precedent in the 18th century palaces of Gorkha and Nuwakot. Each bay is closed off by a window consisting of two shutters, each dived into six glass panes. The circular arch above the windows is framed by carved wood panels depicting foliage. Such unique window designs are extremely rare in the Kathmandu Valley. Similar windows survive in a private house in Kva Hiti, Kathmandu and are documented in a painting of the Basantapur Palace by Ambrose Oldfield (ca. 1850-1863 CE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Platoon House has been the source of much speculation and interesting oral historic accounts. The site and an older house originally belonged to Bhājudeva Brāhmaṇa, the priest of Jayaprakāśa Malla, the last Malla king of Kathmandu. Following the Gorkhalis&#39; conquest of the Kathmandu Valley, the second Śāha king Pratāpa Siṃha gave the house and surrounding land to Abhimāna Siṃha Basnyāta as a land grant. Abhimāna Siṃha Basnyāta was a prominent noble in the court of King Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇa Śāha and contributed to the consolidation of the Gorkha kingdom. Abhimāna Siṃha is said to have begun with the construction of the Palṭana House three days after the ownership of the land was transferred to him in 1777 CE. An inscription, formerly installed at Nārāyaṇa Cuka the courtyard behind Palṭana Ghara, now lost, states that the building was completed on January 10, 1777 CE (Śaka Era 1698). The inscription further records Palṭana Ghara to be &quot;a building with the protection of a line of tilaṅgās (army men) and rich in honor and wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building is currently rented to a number of businesses that use the ground floor for shops and the upstairs for storage. Tilaṅgā Āyurvedālaya, an Ayurveda pharmacy, operates from one bay on the ground floor. The Vaidya family who runs the pharmacy claims that their ancestor, the Royal Vaidya (Ayurveda physician) opened the pharmacy at the request of King Pratāpa Siṃha Śāha in 1776 CE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Basnyāta clan tried to sell the building in 1961 CE, the pharmacy&#39;s owner filed a complaint with the palace and the sale was averted. The Palṭana Ghara has survived in almost original condition without any major alterations except for the modified roof. However, its dilapidated condition urgently requires repairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Paltana Ghar, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/4d6391f7-6f08-487f-a5d3-3cc333593728" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DANAM&nbsp;</a>database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-12-01	p

A gold-plated statue of Maitreya exhibiting the bhaviṣyavyākaraṇamudrā is enshrined as the gandhurī-devatā (main deity) of the Bahī. The locals worship him as Siṃhasārthabāhu. There is another sanctum in the southern side of the Bahī&#39;s courtyard. A north-facing image of Amitābha is enshrined here as the kvāḥpāḥdyaḥ (principal deity). This possibly is the only monastery that has two separate sanctums. The Bahī courtyard also contains four caityas, two pillars, a mandaḥ, and jalahari, along with some statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissimilar to most of the monasteries of the Valley, this Bahī belongs to the Pradhāna clans, but not to any Vajrācārya or Śākya clans. A legend popular among the Newars about the formation of this Bahī narrates that it was initially established in Sāmākhusi. Later, a flood destroyed the monastery, and a trader named Siṃhasārthabāhu returned from his trading voyage to Tibet and dismantled his own house to reconstruct the Bahī where it stands now. Therefore, the Pradhānas of the Thã Bahī revere Siṃhasārthabāhu as their ancestor and worship him as a deity. However, the Tibetan sources credit Atiśā Dīpaṅkara Śrījñāna for the construction of this Bahī. While he travelled from India to Tibet, the king of the Nepāla Valley had welcomed and received him at his palace in 1041 CE. The king built a monastery as per the instructions of Atiśā, which then came to be known as Thama Vihāra (Thã Bahī). However, the Tibetan sources mention that there already were remnants of a foundation of a bahī that was hundreds of years old when Atiśā came here. Therefore, it appears Atiśā only reconstructed this monastery. Dharmasvāmī, a Tibetan monk who lived in Nepal for eight years from 1226 CE-1234 CE, had also visited the Thã Bahī. King Mukundasena of Pālpā had attacked the Bahī during his invasion of the Kathmandu Valley in NS 646 (1526 CE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thã Bahī used to have plenty of real property that yielded sufficient income for maintaining the monastery and&nbsp;carrying out religious, rituals and&nbsp;cultural activities.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Bahī&rsquo;s income decreased drastically, as most of the property have been privatized. A large stretch of land at Sāmākhusi and Manamayju were transferred to individuals, and only very few plots of land now remain in under the Bahī&rsquo;s possession. The lotus pond in front of the Bahī complex&nbsp;was destroyed and encroached upon by a business complex. Therefore, a court case is pending at the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current dispute about the encroachment of the Tha Bahī complex is one of the exemplary cases towards the challenges of old and fascinating cultural heritage preservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Thã Bahī, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/6d22b620-367a-4250-8a51-f1735ca86877" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DANAM&nbsp;</a>database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-11-01	p

It has 27 bays facing north and 13 bays facing west while there are three more bays each on three other sides, making it a 49-bay Phalcā altogether and probably one of the longest arcaded platforms in Nepal. On its first floor, Lāykū Phalcā also displays immaculate woodcarvings on pillars, capitals, beams, cornices, and doors. Wooden statues of various tantric deities like the ten Mahāvidyās are placed at the centre of each capital (metha). The capitals contain carvings and images on the inner side as well. Furthermore, wooden images are installed on the beam (nināḥ) cobering each bay. The central bay among the 27 bays facing north is allocated for the sanctum that houses a śivaliṅga as the main deity. There used to be a two-storey high wooden tower (pula) on top of the sanctum, as to photos taken before the Great Earthquake from 1934. The tower (pula) placed above the sanctum was not reconstructed after the Phalcā&#39;s collapse in that earthquake. The 13-bayed section facing west also contains a sanctum at the centre accessible through an artistic door. A statue of Bhagavatī is enshrined in this sanctum. A second tower with a golden finial raises on top of this sanctum. A triśūla accompanies the finial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An inscription, dated 1683 CE (NS 803), posted on the wall of the Phalcā records its construction. It was constructed during the reign of King Jitāmitra Malla by his sons Ugra Malla and Bhupatindra Malla along with minister Duḥkhi Bhāgirāma (Gutschow 2011, p. 645). Impressed by the construction of the Phalcā and the shrines in it, the king had enforced a new system regarding irrigation canals to facilitate the farmers of Bhaktapur. A few bays and the pula on the eastern section of this phalcā can be seen in a painting by Henry Ambrose Oldfield from 1854 CE. A portion of the 27-bayed section of the phalcā collapsed in the 2015 earthquakes. It was reconstructed by the Department of Archaeology in 2020 CE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No guthi related to the Phalcā is (still) in existence. The daily worship at the shrines of Bhagavatī and śivaliṅga has also been discontinued. The upper floor of the 13-bay section of Lāykū Phalcā accommodates the office of the Department of Archaeology. Souvenir shops operated from the 27-bay section of the Lāykū Phalcā for decades in the past. They were removed from the Phalcā in the 1990s, stating the shops disturbed the ambiance of the palace square (local knowledge, local resident, Śarmā, male, age 69).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Lāykū Phalcā, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/resource/1b0a5033-a1ca-4049-8d6f-d1c7b243eabe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DANAM&nbsp;</a>database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-10-01	p

Andolfatto; 2014-10-02	<p>The&nbsp;śikhara&nbsp;temples of Lamjī stand as unique monuments in the history of west Nepal&rsquo;s architecture. The temples are built following the concept of a&nbsp;pa&ntilde;cāyatana&nbsp;(&ldquo;five altars&rdquo;) setting, thus creating a&nbsp;pa&ntilde;cadevala&nbsp;plan (devala&nbsp;is the term used in western Nepal for&nbsp;śikhara&nbsp;temples).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While&nbsp;śikharas&nbsp;are usually constituted of a curvilinear tower (the actual&nbsp;śikhara), the tower of the central temple in Lamjī Pa&ntilde;cadevala is rectilinear. Elsewhere, this feature is only seen at the Dewal Bajh temple in Bajhang District (<a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/search/sharma/titleCreatorYear/items/C5E2WSPS/item-list" target="_blank">Sharma 2012:</a>&nbsp;241, Pl. 65a). Another unique feature of the site is the presence of a finely carved&nbsp;śivaliṅga&nbsp;on top&nbsp;of the northeastern&nbsp;śikhara. This&nbsp;śivaliṅga&nbsp;was most probably moved from one of the temples&rsquo; sanctum to its current location. The rectilinear tower of the central temple is an interesting indicator of the creativity of medieval builders of western Nepal, who produced variations on a well-established type of architecture. Thus, the&nbsp;Lamjī Pa&ntilde;cadevala appears as an important historical site for the study of Nepalese architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Lamjī Pa&ntilde;cadevala, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/7eb10e0c-df75-4816-b1d3-5a541d6c7d19" target="_blank">DANAM</a>&nbsp;database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-04-01	p

For one, it is free-standing and square, with 16 pillars on which the roof rests. Because of this, it is also called the Sorhakhuṭṭe &ldquo;sixteen-legged&rdquo; Phalcā. Moreover, because the square structure is said to contain nine&nbsp;maṇdaḥs, it is also known as Mandaḥ Phalcā. Another unique feature is that a water tank for drinking water - jaḥdhuṃ - is placed on the platform under the roof. Normally, such a tank could be found next to, but not in a building. Below the jaḥdhuṃ&#39;s outlet is a statue of Bhagīratha. A&nbsp;śivaliṅga&nbsp;is placed right behind the&nbsp;jaḥdhuṃhiti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1750 CE, the Sāḥgaḥ Mandaḥ Phalcā was constructed in memory of a deceased father from an Amatya family from the Dathu Ṭola. Probably, it collapsed during the Great Earthquake of 1934 CE. Since then, only a square plinth along with the śivaliṅga and the jaḥdhuṃ remained until, in 2008, the Department of Archaeology reconstructed the Phalcā under the supervision of Sukra Sagar Shrestha&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/2S8K64WV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(Shokoohy and others 2014, p. 162)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pilgrims used to take the road in front of the Phalcā for their pilgrimage to the Mātātīrtha on Mātātīrtha Aũśī (the new moon day of the dark fortnight of Vaiśākha). Until the late 1970s, local youths used to fill up the jaḥdhuṃ to provide drinking water to the pilgrims and also offered them pāṃti (a mixture of water and coarse brown sugar) on a particular day. This tradition ended in the 1980s. The road also used to be a section of the trade route for the merchants of Citlāṅga (Chitlang) who travelled to Kathmandu and Patan via Kirtipur until the late Rāṇā period. Travellers and merchants presumably used to take shelter at this Phalcā and, In this context, quenched their thirst from the jaḥdhuṃ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Sāḥgaḥ Mandaḥ Phalcā, please visit the<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/fe209a6f-0543-4c9d-96d6-d5bbb307c227" target="_blank">&nbsp;DANAM</a>&nbsp;database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-09-01	p

She is referred to as the clan deity of the Malla Kings in an inscription (now lost) in Bhaktapur. There are three temples dedicated to Vatsalā in the small perimeter of the Bhaktapur Darbar Square. Among them, this south-facing Temple in discussion is located in the centre of the square and is said to be built by King Bhūpatīndra Malla in 1699 CE, i.e., NS 820 (cp. Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī 19.1-73).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It stands out because of its artistic merits and is entirely constructed in stone, except for the pinnacle. The Temple&rsquo;s outer structure rests on 12 columns and has a three-level plinth. A bell supported by ornately designed columns and lintel rests on the lowest plinth and a pair of elephants and lions flank the entrance to the sanctum. Instead of a statue, a stone kalaśa as the representation of the Tantric deity Vatsalā is consecrated inside the sanctum. Most of the Vatsalā temples in the Kathmandu Valley have such aniconic stones to represent her. The local community believes that the deity was offered human sacrifice as part of the Tantric rites (Gutschow 2014, 33). The Devamālāvaṃśāvalī mentions that such rites were performed while consecrating goddess Vatsalā and establishing her shrine in Pashupati (cited from M. Thāpā VS 2077, 183). Furthermore, residents of the area also believe that dogs start crying when the Temple bell is rung. In the Vatsalā Temple at Pashupati, dogs are said to be taken inside the sanctum during some rituals, and members of a certain guṭhī howl like wolves while kneeling and praying. There appear to be some connections between these rituals and strongly held local beliefs. The Temple&rsquo;s structure, except its plinth, crumbled down in the 2015 CE earthquakes, and the Bhaktapur Municipality completed its renovation in 2020 CE (VS 2077).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Vatsalā Mandira, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/75171568-d049-4c63-9fce-ddf40dc4e157" target="_blank">DANAM</a>&nbsp;database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>	2021-08-01	p

Junbesi was the first permanent settlement of the Sherpa people after they crossed over from Tibet in the early 16th century. The original monastery may date to that time. Other sources mention 1635 as the construction date. The monastery was damaged by an earthquake in the 17th century and partly destroyed by fire in 1914. Recent renovations include the replacement of the timber-framed entry porch with a cement and concrete portico. In 2007, the historic courtyard building was demolished and rebuilt as a stone and concrete structure covered with a corrugated metal roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three massive clay statues of Buddha Śākyamuni, Maitreya and Padmasambhava are replacements that were made after the 1914 fire. Local lore has it that the original statues escaped the fire by flying away to an undisclosed location. The upstairs room features a niche with a group of smaller statues representing Buddha Śākyamuni, Maitreya, Padmasambhava, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana amongst others.

It is an arcaded platform with multiple functions for social gatherings, inviting elderly people to spend their leisure time sitting and chatting, men of all ages to play cards, read newspapers or deposit temporarily loads, children to play. Pāṭīscan be used for religious purposes in a neighbourhood, such as playing bhajanas (devotional songs) in the mornings and evenings of particular auspicious days, and some selected ones become crucial for the distribution of ritual food such as samaybaji, devotional singing or community assembling during the religious chariot processions (e.g., Indra Yātrā, Buṅgadyaḥ Yātrā, see&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/69370820-1ef5-11ea-b74e-0242ac130002" target="_blank">LAL4198</a>). Once a new chariot is constructed, fragments of the old ones are placed in front of selected pāṭīs and worshipped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of the phalcā goes back to the Licchavi period, but their use, and presence has changed over time, and with socio-spatial, demographic dynamics. Whether endangered by encroachment or demolition, whether cherished or even rejuvenated depends on the community/locality caring for the phalcā. Though partly endangered, the phalcā is not on its &sbquo;way out&rsquo;. Even today, communities invest in the construction of new pāṭīs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarāḥ Phalcā stands out for its remarkable pillar carvings. Located in Ikhachen (Ikhācheṃ), to the east of Tapahiti, the original name of the Phalcā is Sadāvarta Phalcā, most likely&nbsp;because it was constructed under the Sadāvarta Guṭhī of Śreṣṭhas from Ikhachen. No evidence could be found with which to date&nbsp;its initial construction. However, relying upon the wood carvings of the monument, it appears that at least the pillars were constructed during the late Malla period. Until the early 2000s, a library was kept in the Sarāḥ Phalcā, but it was closed down. The Phalcā is in severely&nbsp;endangered as it currently lacks a roof (covered by a large tarpaulin). This was removed and has not yet been replaced, meaning that&nbsp;the Phalcā is not appropriately protected from the&nbsp;heavy monsoon rains. In November 2019, several of its&nbsp;side walls were dismantled and rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/81f57520-f0b7-11e9-a3c8-0242ac130002" target="_blank">DANAM SUN4210:</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<figure class="image" style="float:left"><img alt="" height="267" src="/files/uploadedfiles/ckeditor/uploads/2022/02/06/sun4210_p_20191017_08-1.webp" width="400" />\r\n<figcaption>Dāphā Phalcā, view from SW (October 2019)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Dāphā Phalcā, also called Cībhāḥ Phalcā, is located at the side of a busy road in the small town of Sunaguthi (or Sunakothi). It has finely carved pillars, decorative cornices, and a three-bay window. However, it is in a very neglected state and is missing its original roof.&nbsp;The roof currently consists of corrugated metal sheets&nbsp;supported by a make-shift structure of crudely shaped sticks. The window frames are damaged and sections of the carved frames are missing. This&nbsp;once free-standing Phalcā is further encroached upon by neighbouring private buildings. The floor and walls of the Phalcā are covered with cement plaster, which has led to the spread of&nbsp;damp. Two plywood door panels provide a way to the back room and have been inserted into poorly carved frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Phalcā is mainly related to the Caitya which stands in front of it. During the anniversary celebration (varṣavarddhanapūjā) of the Caitya and other ritual worships, people use the building as a resting place. The local Jyāpu-community chants devotional songs at the Phalcā during the months of&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/glossary/meaning/17e908a4-676c-4503-82e0-b4e58b72496b/" target="_blank">Gũlā</a>&nbsp;(Śrāvaṇa-Bhādra) and Kārtika. According to a local elder, the Nāmasaṅgīti is also recited here during some of the festivals. On the 8th day of the bright fortnight of Śrāvaṇa, local residents from Sunaguthi offer religious gifts to their Vajrācārya priests at the Phalcā.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/8f55831e-9d6d-11ea-9766-0242ac130005" target="_blank">DANAM LAL4212</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<figure class="image" style="float:left"><img alt="" height="286" src="/files/uploadedfiles/ckeditor/uploads/2022/02/06/lal4212_p_20200524_02.webp" width="400" />\r\n<figcaption>Kotalāchi Phalcā, view from NE; photo by Thomas Schrom; 2020-05-24</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Kotalāchi Phalcā, view from NE; photo by Thomas Schrom; 2020-05-24</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This unusually shaped Phalcā dates back to the first half of the 19th century.

The Jumli bridges stand out for the unique sculptural decorations found on vertical posts, with iconographies ranging from images of soldiers with rifles, planes, protectors or geometric shapes. Usually not older than fifty years, their cyclical construction requires large trees (a material more and more rare to procure) and a special knowledge of the technology.

There is some debate about the Bāhāḥ&#39;s initial construction date. Karel Rijk van Kooij&nbsp;(1977, 39-82)&nbsp;is of the opinion that the iconography and stylistic details of the roof brackets are concurrent with drawings found in 11th century manuscripts. &nbsp;Shantaram&nbsp;Balchandra Deo&nbsp;(1969, 10-11)&nbsp;has dated the struts to the 14th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest dated sources related to the Bāhāḥ are two stone inscriptions issued during the reign of King Pratāpa Malla (r. 1641-74): A nicely preserved inscription from NS 788 (1668 CE) and a damaged inscription, most probably issued before NS 788 (1668 CE). The physical and palaeographical features of these inscriptions suggest that they were issued by the same person within a period of a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NS 788 (1668 CE) inscription records the consecration of Guṇākara Mahāvihāra (Chusyā Bāhāḥ) &lsquo;guṇākara mahāvihāra pratiṣṭhā saṃpūrṇa yāṅana&rsquo; and the installation of Harāhara Lokeśvara sponsored by a person named Guṇajyoti (text: Guṇajoti) Vajrācārya together with his family members from Dhvākhā Bāhāḥ; the damaged inscription mentions the completion of the Bāhāḥ &lsquo;thva vihara dayakā&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third inscription installed inside the sanctum of the Bāhāḥ also by Guṇajyoti in NS 769 (1649 CE) records the renovation of a rest-house (capāḥ) constructed by his father J&ntilde;ānajyoti (text: J&ntilde;ānajoti) in honour of their clan deity, Maricī Devī. This indicates that there was a shrine or a pīṭha (abode) dedicated to Maricī Devī nearby. Chusyā Bāhāḥ is not mentioned in this inscription. If the expansive Mahāvihāra had existed here during this time, it would probably have been mentioned in the inscription which records the family tree of Guṇajyoti and the renovation of the capāḥ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, it is likely that the broken inscription was issued after NS 769 (1649 CE). We can then conclude that the Bāhāḥ must have been constructed sometime after NS 769 (1649 CE), and was consecrated (probably after its renovation) in NS 788 (1668 CE). One could even argue that Guṇajyoti converted the capāḥ built by his father into a bāhāḥ and named it Guṇākara Mahāvihāra (Chusyā Bāhāḥ) after him. Chusyā Bāhāḥ&#39;s saṅgha members believe that Guṇajyoti constructed the Bāhāḥ by spending his income generated from his trade in Tibet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Chusyā Bāhāḥ, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/report/b92b7a0f-0268-43e8-bbe2-d83d39d6e54b" target="_blank">DANAM</a>&nbsp;database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>	2021-02-01	p
