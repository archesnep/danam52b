6	New Project on the Anthropology of Inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley	new-project-on-the-anthropology-of-inscriptions-in-the-kathmandu-valley	<p>Christiane Brosius and Astrid Zotter receive a nine-month seed funding for a new project on the &ldquo;Anthropology of Inscriptions: Memory and Cultural Heritage in the Public Sphere&rdquo; within the frame of the Flagship Initiative &ldquo;Transforming Cultural Heritage&rdquo;, which Simon Cubelic will also join as research fellow. The rich inscription heritage of Kathmandu Valley dates back to the 2nd century AD. Up to the present day, inscriptions are omnipresent in Nepal&rsquo;s religious and public life. Written artefacts in Sanskrit, Newari and Nepali language recording grants, donations or the establishment of trusts are found on temples, shrines, wells and rest houses alike. Due to the rapid urbanization, infrastructure development or natural disasters many inscriptions are currently highly endangered. Nowadays, NGOs, (inter-)national institutions or private donors sponsoring the preservation of heritage sites add to Nepal&rsquo;s epigraphical tradition through the installation of commemorative plaques.</p>\r\n<p>The project aims at investigating the crucial role inscriptions, graffiti, or other publicly displayed media of written communication has played for the construction of spaces, identities, and collective memory in the Kathmandu Valley. A selected corpus of inscriptions from the 15th century to the present will be documented, edited, and published in digital form in close collaboration with the Nepal Heritage Documentation Project (NHDP), the Research Unit &ldquo;Documents on the History of Religion and Law of Premodern Nepal&rdquo; (HAdW) and the University Library Heidelberg. Textual data will be enriched by meta- and norm data and linked with digitally available ethnographic material (videos, oral histories, maps), monument documentation, or archival sources they are related to. By drawing on methods from Visual Anthropology and Philology, the inscriptions will be studied from an interdisciplinary and transtemporal perspective: as images and texts; as sediments of past meaning and sites of contemporary struggles; as historical objects embedded in monument sites, but also as literate practices through which ritual and festive activity are connected to heritage scapes. Thereby the project wants not only to contribute to a better understanding of the linkage between tangible and intangible heritage but also to interrogate the concept of cultural heritage by opening it up for local notions from the past and present.</p>\r\n<p>This project will greatly enhance the work for NHDP, and we hope that the interaction between the two will contribute to the shared aim of preserving Nepal&rsquo;s cultural heritage and compiling an openly accessible database for the current and future generations of researchers and enthusiasts.</p>	2020-10-16 05:00:00+00	p
7	NHDP Granted Six-Year Extension	nhdp-granted-six-year-extension	<p>NHDP has received a grant to continue its work for six more years. The new grant will allow us to continue the work in the Kathmandu valley, and expand it to western Nepal and other places that are culturally and historically related to the Kathmandu valley. NHDP is the first project to comprehensively photograph, describe, survey, analyse these monuments, and make the records available in an open database. The project aims to document and inventory more than 2,000 monuments (temples, monasteries, palaces, and other historic buildings), 2,500 inscriptions, and 8,000 objects, as well as the unique intangible cultural heritage associated with the monuments: rituals, festivals, and other social and religious events and practices. The project will also focus on the monuments endangered by earthquakes and urban change that have not yet been thoroughly documented. This initiative has already played an important role, for example, in the reconstruction of monuments after the devastating earthquakes of 2015. The data resulting from the documentation will be available on the Digital Archive of Nepalese Arts and Architecture (<a href="http://localhost:8000/index.htm">DANAM</a>) and Heidelberg University Library&rsquo;s image database,&nbsp;<a href="https://heidicon.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HeidICON</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The NHDP will collaborate again with the&nbsp;<a href="http://thesaraffoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saraf</a>&nbsp;Foundation for Himalayan Traditions and Culture, the&nbsp;<a href="http://doa.gov.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Archaeology</a>&nbsp;of the Nepalese government, the&nbsp;<a href="https://kvptnepal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.unesco.org/fieldoffice/kathmandu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO Nepal</a>&nbsp;and other partners.

13	Workshop and Lecture with Bruce McCoy Owens	workshop-and-lecture-with-bruce-mccoy-owens	<p>On May 22 and 23, Bruce McCoy Owens, associate professor of Anthropology at Wheaton College, visited the HCTS to participate in a workshop on DANAM and to give a lecture on &ldquo;Intangible Heritage and Visual Repatriation&rdquo;. He was hosted by the NHDP project and the professorship of Visual and Media Anthropology.</p>\r\n<p>During a workshop on Wednesday, May 22, members of the Nepal Heritage Documentation Project introduced Bruce Owens to DANAM, the Digital Archive of Nepalese Arts and Monuments, which has been and continues to be developed by the NHDP. After testing DANAM and Abhilekha, the document database supporting the archive, further improvements were discussed, such as the implementation of glossaries, references, and other resource models. Also initiated by the NHDP, Bruce Owens then gave a lecture the following day on "Intangible Heritage and Visual Repatriation: an ethnography of three exhibitions in Nepal". The talk took place in the frame of Prof. Christiane Brosius&acute; student course "Collecting, mapping, archiving, exhibiting: practices of knowledge production".</p>\r\n<p>The talk considered the various opportunities and challenges that are presented by displaying photographs that depict intangible heritage to those whose heritage is portrayed within them. Prof. Owens explored these issues as he engaged with them in the process of planning and mounting three exhibitions of photographs of the annual chariot festival of Rāto Matsyendranāth in the Kathmandu Valley in the fall of 2016.</p>\r\n<p>These exhibitions required that he negotiated the diverse interests of those represented as well as the interests of others he encountered in these representations. Among the issues considered were the tensions between aesthetic value and documentary accuracy; divergent aesthetic principles among viewers and subjects; privileging the past and honoring the present; practicing visual elicitation while in the process of visual repatriation, and the role of ethnographic photography in an age of photographic ubiquity and pervasive social mediatization. <a href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bruce-owens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce McCoy Owens</a> is an associate professor of Anthropology at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheaton College, Massachusetts</a>, and coordinator of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rtc.bt/index.php/aboutrtc/accreditation/83-rtc/141-the-wheaton-rtc-study-abroad-program-wins-national-accolade-in-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheaton/Royal Thimphu College Partnership Program.</a></p>\r\n<p>He presented his photographs about the celebrations of the Rāto Matsyendranāthko Rath Jātrā at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.photoktm.com/2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo Kathmandu 2016</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/hcts/hcts-projects/nhdp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nepal Heritage Documentation Project (NHDP)</a>&nbsp;is headed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/de/personen/person/persdetail/brosius.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Christiane Brosius</a>, the HCTS Professor of Visual and Media Anthropology, together with <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/people/person/persdetail/michaels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Axel Michaels</a>, former director of the Cluster of Excellence &ldquo;Asia and Europe&rdquo; and founding director of CATS, the Centre for Asian and Transcultural Studies.

21	Launch of CHIMS	launch-of-chims	<p>NHDP is happy to announce its contribution to the new online database of the Department of Archaeology (DoA), Government of Nepal. The CHIMS (Cultural Heritage Information Management System) was launched on 18th of April 2021, World Heritage Day. The event was divided into three sections: the inaugural speech Mr. Damodar Gautam, Director General, DoA; the introductory presentation to CHIMS by Dr. Suresh Saras Shrestha, Under- Secretary and Head of the World Heritage Conservation Section; and the CHIMS technical presentation and live demonstration by NHDP staff Bishwo Bijaya Shah and Ashish Gautam who developed and realised the system.</p>\r\n<p>CHIMS is a database management system, based on ARCHES, the open-source software platform for cultural heritage data management (developed by the Getty Institute and World Monument Fund) that facilitates an open access digitalized inventory of Nepal&rsquo;s cultural heritage. It ensures that information on interventions, documentation, assessment and research are compiled and made easily accessible online for a wider public. It will serve as new site managementtool, as it centralizes information on conservation status, materials, interventions, needed maintenance, weaknesses and risks.&nbsp;CHIMS and DANAM are not only connected by the usage of the ARCHES software but also by the shared goal of documenting Nepal&rsquo;s cultural heritage and presenting it in an open-access format. We hope that this connection between the two databases leads to productive exchanges that enrich both of them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For more details, go to <a href="https://www.heritage.gov.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.heritage.gov.np/.</a></p>	2021-05-25 05:00:00+00	p
22	Prestigious Jeonju International Award (JIAPICH) promotes Intangible Heritage from Lalitpur, Nepal	prestigious-jeonju-international-award-jiapich-promotes-intangible-heritage-from-lalitpur-nepal	<p>Among three finalists, the South Korean JIAPICH has honored <strong>Mr. Dil Kumar Barahi</strong>, the leader (<em>naya</em>) of the Barahi Da Guthi (association). This socio-religious association specializes on carpentry, precisely on the woodwork needed for the processional chariot of the Newar deity of Buṅgadyaḥ, also referred to as Lord Karuṇāmaya or, for Hindus, the Rāto (Red) Matsyendranātha. This prominent deity from the Kathmandu Valley is taken out for annual procession on the 10 meter high mobile temple that is reassembled in March/April each year, whereby Mr. Barahi and his association are responsible for the wooden structure and details of the architecture of the impressive wagon.</p>\r\n<p>Every twelve years, the chariot is made anew, with the exception of the gilded parts attached to it. Mr. Barahi has literally devoted his whole life to this work, which entails the knowledge passed down from one generation to another. He has not only contributed in continuity of the traditional skills and practices but also is ensuring for future continuity by teaching younger generations within the Barahi community to smoothen wooden structures, make holes in the wood, for beginners and assemble the structure of this mobile chariot in which the deity gets pulled by devotees between his fixed residences in the Newar town of Bungamati and the ancient city of Patan. Of key importance thereby is Mr. Barahi&rsquo;s commitment to keeping the vivid culture alive by teaching knowledge beyond manual skills, including ritual practice. The work of Mr. Barahi is thus a crucial contribution to the dynamic and festive intangible heritage of the Valley. The procession and the making of the chariot mirror the complex fabric of Newar society, their history, caste patterns, and spatial distribution across the Valley.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Barahi has contributed immensely to our research on the role of inscriptions in alerting us to the role of particular groups in the procession, and how they collaborate and share knowledge to make this all happen,&rdquo; says Dr. Monalisa Maharjan, who was trained in intangible heritage research in Portugal and currently works with researchers in the Nepal Heritage Documentation Project funded by the Arcadia Fund and based in Patan and Heidelberg. The intangible heritage is also recorded in manuscripts and inscriptions, some of which are hundreds of years old and either stored in temples or shrines or travelling with the chariot. Aligned to the documentation project is a research project called &ldquo;the Anthropology of Inscriptions,&rdquo; funded by the Flagship Initiative Transforming Cultural Heritage at Heidelberg University. With Mr. Barahi&rsquo;s help, the researchers, Dr Monalisa Maharjan and Dr Nutandhar Sharma could identify many inscriptions including manuscripts and knowledge about the woodwork of the chariot. They enter the data into a free and open access database (<a href="../../../../../">https://danam.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/</a>), with the support of Rajan Kathiwoda and Dr. Simon Cubelic.</p>\r\n<p>NHDP is confident that with this international recognition of Mr. Barahi and his association&rsquo;s work the often invisible work of the hands and lives working tirelessly and selflessly for several generations in enabling Nepal&rsquo;s heritage to continue will be recognized further. Moreover, the aspiration is that such honoring of the practice and knowledge will contribute to encourage members of young generations of Nepalis to join in safeguarding those skills.</p>\r\n<p>With the aim of safeguarding and promoting Intangible Cultural Heritage, Jeonju City in South Korea has been organizing international award since 2019. The award focuses on Living Human Treasurers (practitioners), groups, communities, administrators, researchers, NGOs and those who have made substantial contributions for promoting Intangible Cultural Heritage. As an honor for the contribution of individuals or organization each year the chosen three finalists will be distributed $30,000 USD among the finalists and a Plaque.</p>	2021-08-06 05:00:00+00	p
