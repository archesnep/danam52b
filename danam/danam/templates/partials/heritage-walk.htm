                            NHDP is not only documenting individual sites of endangered heritage in the Kathmandu Valley
                            or in West Nepal. The team also records the use made of the sites and how they contribute to
                            ritual practice – which is central in keeping the heritage alive. Often, sites are related
                            to each other, for instance, through ritual practice such as processions. In fact, in places
                            like the royal city of Patan we can see that processions still play an important role for
                            communities. We have selected a few procession walks for you that will be shared with you
                            over the next months.

                            life in Nepal in a dramatic way. It restricted a lot of rituals and altered them in
                            interesting ways. Our research fellow Dr Nutandhar Sharma, accompanied by photographer
                            Nashib Kafle (2020) and architect Bijay Basukala (2021) documented some of the rituals
                            performed during the Dīpaṅkara procession, connecting them to selected sites of cultural
                            heritage that can be found on DANAM. Christiane Brosius edited the material and selected the

                            The Dīpaṅkara Buddha, or ‘Maker of Light’, is said to predate the historical Gautama Buddha,
                            and is often equated with the first Buddha (Michaels 2013: 2). Pañcadāna (lit. ‘five
                            offerings’) is a festival in which the initiated Śākya and Vajrācārya males have to manifest
                            their monastic status by going from house to house to collect alms from at least seven
                            houses. In the historic city of Patan, this festival, is known as Yala (Patan) Pañcadāna. It
                            is celebrated on the 8th lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Śrāvaṇa month according to
                            the lunar calendar; in 2020, that day fell on July 28.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            On the day of Pañcadāna, initiated male lay devotees offer alms to the Vajracārya priests
                            and Sākya householder monks. Of central importance is Phudyaḥ - a c. 60 cm high gold-plated
                            copper icon of Dīpaṅkara Buddha. The icon of the deity is carried from house to house, from
                            monastery to monastery, by the Śākyas of Ukubahāl monastery. When the deity visits the
                            selected places, it is worshipped with gifts (dāna). Offerings are mainly rice grains, wheat
                            grains, salt, fruits, money and the likes.

                            The Phudyaḥ jātrā continues from the morning until late evening. The icon of Phudyaḥ,
                            usually kept in the Ukubaha monastery, is cleaned one day before and on the next day, in the
                            morning on the very day of the jātrā, it is displayed in the northern wing of the monastery
                            with its ornaments and full decorations. At that time, local residents, mainly Śākyas of the
                            locality, come to offer their pūjā and alms to the deity. After that the jātrā begins its
                            traditional route (see the route map).

                            The route can be divided into several parts. The first circumambulation in the morning
                            starts from Ukubaha and follows the localities accordingly: (1) Sundhara, (2) Guita, (3)
                            Subaha, (4) Bhinchebaha, (5) Tyāga, (6) Tvaybaha, (7) Yacchubaha, (8) Yanamugal, (9)

                            Hitiphusabaha, (15) Nagubaha, (16) Kanibaha, (17) Ubabahi, (18) Dunebaha, (19) Mahabauddha,
                            (20) Ukubaha. Even upon returning to its home-monastery, the icon of the deity does not
                            enter the vihara. It remains outside while human participants are allowed to enter the
                            monastery to have their lunch). The second circumambulation – from noon to evening – starts
                            form Ukubaha and follows these localities: (1) Gangabaha, (2) Dhandyabaha, (3) Dyanani (4)
                            Bakunani, (5) Darbar, (6) Tangabaha, (7) Cukabaha, (8) Tabaha, (9) Jombaha, (10)
                            Nhaykanbahi, (11) Talache, (12) Kvache, (13) Bahalukha, (14) Kaygunani, (15) Daubaha, (16)

                        <p class="text-justify mt-0">
                            As almost all festivals of the Kathmandu Valley were affected by COVID-19 pandemic, either
                            banned, delayed or very simply celebrated, this Phudyaḥ jātrā was also nearly put on halt in
                            2020. On July 20, a big discussion about organizing the Pañcadāna festival was held among
                            the executive members of Organization of Buddhist Monasteries of Patan, representatives of
                            all Buddhist monasteries of Patan, of the Committee for the study on Vajrācārya Pūjā and
                            Rituals (Vajrācārya Pūjā Vidhi Addhyayan Samiti) and of the Organization of Traditional
                            Buddhadharma of Nepal (Nepala Paramparāgata Bauddhadharma Saṃgha). They unanimously decided
                            to celebrate the Pañcadāna festival only under the limited boundary of their own monastery
                            to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. According to a senior member of the vihāra, the
                            members of Ukubahā monastery decided to continue the Phudyaḥ Jātrā because several devotees
                            would not take their food without offering ritual gifts (dāna) to Phudyaḥ on that day. They
                            also decided that without invitation, the jātrā members would not enter any vihāra or house.
