Its <em>guṭhī</em>&nbsp;was established at the same time, and land was donated to fund the&nbsp;organisation of annual rituals. However, these days (writing in 2018) the <em>guṭhī</em> no longer exists. Some of&nbsp;the rituals have therefore also come to an end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One can find images of the donors at the bottom of the inscription and&nbsp;a small image of Bhairava flanked by two deities above it. The deity is shown&nbsp;standing in a <em>ālīḍha</em> posture with four arms; he is holding <em>khaḍga</em> and <em>khaṭvāṁk</em>a in his upper two hands.&nbsp;</p>

This work was&nbsp;supported by GTZ/udle and funds of&nbsp;RS. 118,237. Local people also contributed their physical labour to complete the renovation, which&nbsp;lasted from March-September 1993. The unpublished GTZ report reads as follows: &quot;The damage - as is usual in the local architecture - had started from the roof. All rafters and eave boards were rotten due to several years of unchecked monsoon rain. The floor plankings were reusable, only a small amount of plankings was missing. the timber wainscote (wll panels) was damaged and not reusable. The east corner <em>dachi apa wall a</em>nd plinth wall were in very poor condition.&nbsp;The wainscote on the back wall was replaced with all new sal timbers. The few missing floor planks [were]&nbsp;replaced. All columns were in good condition and only cleaned. All the rafters and eave boards were replaced with new sal timber. The east corner <em>dachi apa</em> wall, plinth wall and back wall were repaired using traditional mud mortar and<em> dachi apa</em> and <em>ma apa</em>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report also describes the south-east corner:&nbsp;&quot;This is one of the most damage [sic]&nbsp;portion of Pati at South-East corner in front. Many bricks are missing from wall. And lower part of timber post is leaning outside with timber base (Lanka-Si) and stone. Only remaining even in this condition, because it was shoved by a small piece of timber. Mostly roofing timbers are not usable. All the eave boards are rotten by water and also rafters, whih are mostly damaged at the end.

<p>Six weeks of research went into the reconstruction process, where researchers tried&nbsp;to work out what the Cābāhāḥ Phalcā may once have looked like&nbsp;(its earlier forms had not been documented). Four different options for the front facade were developed and then shared with the community elders, who were ultimately responsible for the final decision. The window designs were copied from similar&nbsp;<em>phalcā </em>dating back to the same period in the&nbsp;Chochhe Gallī area<em>. </em>Emphasis was given to the use of traditional building materials and craftsmanship, something&nbsp;which was uncommon back then.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reconstruction was also an attempt to challenge common views that traditional materials are not sustainable; those who argue this often propose&nbsp;cement be used instead. The process also included training workshops for and by traditional craftsmanship. Two new pillars were recarved on the basis of the historical model. Because it was in such&nbsp;bad shape, a layer of bricks adjacent to the residential house to the west was removed and replaced with<em> ma apā</em>&nbsp;using yellow mud mortar. The niches were installed in line with&nbsp;the photographs taken prior&nbsp;to the dismantling of the rear wall, and&nbsp;the stone statues of the guardian deities Gaṇeśa, Lokeśvara Kumāra, Umāmaheśvara&nbsp;and two others of Cābahā Phalcā were stored there. These statues have&nbsp;been carved anew. Some innovative measures were also introduced, such as putting a waterproof membrane between the planks and the mud bed for the roof tiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report prepared by KVPT shows that the restoration of Kota Pāṭī was supported by the 2009 US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation Large Grant (along with Ml Chowk and two Stone Gates). The report (p.2) reads as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Prior to restoration, Kot Pati rest house was a series of makeshift rooms separated by partition walls. After the successful completion of the restoration program, the rest house now appears in its original configuration as&nbsp;continuous long arcade as documented in historic photographs. As with most of the other buildings in the complex, the Pati&rsquo;s historical tiled roof had been replaced with machine-made flat pan tiles laid onto the timber battens, causing significant water leakage right through the building. This meant that large sections of the structure had to be dismantled and reconstructed using new timber elements. Out of the 34 carved columns and capitals 31 could be restored and were professionally cleaned and reinstalled in their original positions. All historic pillars required new sections of timber to be grafted to their base sections. Two original windows in the western section of the Pati were restored whereas all other small openings above the arcade had to be made new. The new roof structure and cover were designed in the traditional manner. The redundant horizontal ceiling planks were removed to allow for a more spacious and luminous interior. 1 inch hardwood planking and 3/4 inch marine-grade plywood united the roof timber members to create a strong diaphragm and uniform surface for a water proof membrane. Traditional terracotta roof tiles were then placed on a mud-bed on top of the membrane. The fl ooring was covered with traditional terracotta tiles, fa.ades were rebuilt using <em>ma-apa&nbsp;</em>bricks, and the buttresses supporting the brick wall were consolidated.&quot;</p>

<p>Further down, on pp 4-5, the report continues:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The restoration of Kot Pati progressed quickly. Partition walls were dismantled so that the space retained its original character as a long arcade. Tiling and soling of the floors was completed, and the back wall&rsquo;s supporting buttresses were rebuilt. Finally, the entire roof structure and cover was replaced.</p>

<p>Detailed Activities:</p>

<p>- The existing Kot Pati needed to be almost completely dismantled as it was in a highly dilapidated condition. All redundant partition walls and horizontal ceiling planks were removed.</p>

<p>- The missing or damaged stone pavement, plinth edges, and mouldings were recreated following existing historic examples.</p>

<p>- The historic plinth was completely re-built along the face of the Pati using edge stones and<em> telia</em> tile.</p>

<p>- The cement pavement was removed and&nbsp;the floor of the Pati was repaved with traditional floor tiles (<em>cikã apā)&nbsp;</em>in lime and brick dust (<em>surki</em>)<em> </em>mortar.</p>

<p>- The existing roof was removed and&nbsp;a new roof structure was constructed in its place with new closely-space timber joists in a traditional configuration</p>

<p>- Hardwood planks and marine-grade plywood unite the roof timber members, creating a strong diaphragm and uniform surface for a waterproof membrane.</p>

<p>- Traditional terracotta roof tiles were laid on a mud-bed on top of the membrane.</p>

<p>- New windows, designed&nbsp;to mirror the old ones, were installed on the principal facade.</p>

<p>- A PVC pipe was installed underground, running just along the Pati&rsquo;s plinth for telephone wiring.</p>

<p>&quot;Repair of the Kuti Saugal Pati. At the request of the local community and Chandra Pustakalaya of Kuti Saugal Tole, Patan Programme undertook&nbsp;in May 1993 to renovate this resthouse (pati). Construction was finished in October 1993.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Existing condition:&nbsp;</strong>The main damage to the structure was in the roof, the Achilles tendon of the local architecture. Because&nbsp;all the existing timber was pine, roof damage had quickly led to complete deterioration of this less durable wood. As the floor of the resthouse was finished only in clay, most people chose to sit on the wall across the pokhari (pond) across the lane rather than in this pati.</p>

<p><strong>Repair work</strong>:&nbsp; The timber floor structure was replaced with all new sal timber: new sal floor planking was also provided. The timber beam above the columns was replaced with sal timber wood to match the historical size and shape. All columns were in good condition and only cleaned. The brick wall below the floor level, the front wall above the timber beam, and a few brick layers at the back wall were repaired using traditional mud mortar and old&nbsp;<em>ma-apa</em>. The roof was repaired using almost all new sal timbers and planks, incorporating a waterproofing membrane of tarfelt.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong>Project dates May 1993-October 1993, Total costs including construction, design, implementation, supervision: Rs 178,582 &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The UNESCO Kathmandu Office contributed the architectural documentation, the detailed reconstruction design and provided technical supervision. Nepal&rsquo;s Department of Archaeology acted as the overall authority and was responsible for technical backstopping and ensuring that restoration guidelines for a World Heritage Site were followed.</p>

<p>In November 2017 CE, SFMC identified a group of qualified craftsmen from Bhaktapur to rebuild&nbsp;the masonry structure from the ground up.&nbsp;The lowest tier of the Caitya was rebuilt according to the excavation drawings with one rectangular cavity and four L-shaped voids that were later filled with <em>tsha-tshas</em> and terracotta statues placed in the same positions as they had been found in during the dismantling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As level after the level was added stone sculptures were immediately installed in their niches under the priests&rsquo; supervision. A suitable, over 5 meters long hardwood pole was sourced at a local lumber mill and shaped into an octagonal cross-section following traditional design patterns. The poorly crafted stone spire, which likely dates from the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, was carefully reworked, achieving a more uniform shape and its central hole was enlarged to fit the new timber pole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally, the finial was made of simple stone which had been whitewashed. During the reconstruction, the damage to the stone was filled in with a composite repairing material and then remounted. At this stage, a generous donor came forward, offering to pay for a new gilt-copper cladding for the finial; it is this that is now seen atop the restored Tashi Gomang.</p>

<p>Following the completion of the renovation work, the auspicious date of August 23, 2019 CE, was chosen for the final rituals.

<p>The main priest, Vijay Vilash Bajracharya from Makhan, who bears the title of Śāntikarācārya, and his assistant priests conducted the ceremonies.

<p>Transferring the divinity back into the Caitya (<em>jīvanyāsa likāyegu pūjā</em>) was the reversed process of the transferring out ritual. The vase was worshipped and the priest invoked the divinity by reciting <em>mantras</em>. A five-coloured ritual thread (<em>pa&ntilde;casūtra</em>) was tied between the vase and the Caitya to guide the divinity and thus ritually transfer it back into the newly renovated Caitya. The offering of black soot to the divinity marked the moment when the divinity took up residency in the Caitya again and made it venerable.</p>

All of the original timber columns were reused. The wainscote on the back wall was provided at the request of local elders.

<p><em>Rough Translation of the stone inscription of the Phalcā (by N. Sharma):</em></p>

<p>[Svasti sign]. &nbsp;On the 5th day of the bright half of the Lunar month of Āṣāḍha in NS 826 (1706 CE) in the constellation of Uttarā Phālgunī, in the combination of Parigha, on Thursday, on this day, the whole family of Vyanjankars of Cheri Yantāgṛha of Ombahāl led by Viśva, the&nbsp;<em>thakāli</em>&nbsp;(senior person and guthi member) renovated the&nbsp;<em>capāḥ</em>&nbsp;which was here from earlier times. &nbsp;Whatever is necessary for the&nbsp;<em>capāḥ</em>, the responsibility [to fulfill this]&nbsp;goes to the family. Nobody else is allowed to create trouble. The upper part of the&nbsp;<em>capāḥ</em>&nbsp;shall be under the control of the family. If anybody else creates problems, s/he shall get five kinds of great sins such as killing a cow or a Brahman etc. If anybody else does better s/he shall get prosperity.&nbsp; Witness is Rāmakṛṣṇa Bhāro. May all be well.</p>

The monument caught the attention of artists and cultural actors and caused an agitated public debate surrounding the definition of ownership of endangered cultural heritage. Seb Toussaint and his Outsiders Krew were accused of abusing&nbsp;religious sites and local people for the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; purposes; i.e. harming sites through sacrilege and &#39;insulting&#39; their &#39;authentic&#39; purposes&nbsp;instead of working to beautify&nbsp;underprivileged sites. The art group travels around the world and visits impoverished and neglected urban settlements, where they&nbsp;invite&nbsp;local inhabitants to &lsquo;participate&rsquo; in the beautification of their area&nbsp;by selecting meaningful words that the artists then, sometimes with the help of local artists or laymen, paint on the walls of residential houses. The Sataḥ at Purohitaghāṭa was the first example of a religious compound being&nbsp;used in the art project, which is why it enraged&nbsp;some groups even&nbsp;a few weeks after the wall had been already painted and sprayed. The question of &lsquo;Whose heritage&rsquo; was raised, and ranged between accusations of iconoclasm against a Hindu temple (though the Shiva temple lied behind the Sataḥ at Purohitaghāṭa) to damaging heritage structures (such as&nbsp;spraying unremovable paint onto a rare window design from 1883). One critic argued that, &ldquo;the Shiva Temple, though not on the World Heritage Site List, has something to contribute to the remarkable cultural heritage and legacy of Nepal. Any kind of intruding and defacing it would be overlooking history of the place and hurting sentiments of my people.&rdquo; (in <strong>Thapa 2014</strong>)</p>

<p>The case is also&nbsp;interesting because it draws attention to the fact that the Satah had long been in a dilapidated state and sidelined by public attention. Some Nepalis questioned why this had been the case for so long, and why it took foreign artwork to notice this.&nbsp;As such, these voices found the&nbsp;accusations&nbsp;ambivalent, claiming that&nbsp;had the site been recognised as heritage, people would have cared about its neglected state beforehand.&nbsp;The fact that it was left uncared for for so long was seen as a sign of ignorance on behalf of the Nepalese people&nbsp;vis-&agrave;-vis their own heritage.</p>

<p><strong>Thapa (2014)&nbsp;</strong>refers to Niels Gutschow&rsquo;s mention of the site in his third volume of Architecture of Newars: &ldquo;The sattal at Purohitghat was one of the smaller endowments, but probably the most fascinating one. The baluster columns and the cusped arches of the arcade follow early 19th century prototypes, but the first floor windows went beyond the scope of carved window frames &hellip; The frames of the side openings add to the stunning design, contributing to a move that culminates in the flower motifs that crown the central opening. In a playful manner, curled appendages frame the entire window, flush with the wall&ldquo; (see primary image).</p>

<p><strong>Mahaju (2015) </strong>connects&nbsp;cultural heritage&nbsp;to the idea of national progress and development&nbsp;for which it has often been sacrificed, showing that cultural heritage has been dramatically endangered&nbsp;in times of urban transformation: &ldquo;in 1993/4, during the construction of the Bagmati Bridge in Thapathali, the government tore down a historic temple and a pati. What remains of the complex is cramped away in one corner. The government had assured the public that those structures will be relocated with due honour as it merits a place of worship. Twenty one years hence, the promise still hangs in the air. The recent road widening also has upset conservationists and heritage practitioners, common people notwithstanding, at how the government has treated places of utmost importance.&rdquo;</p>

This text was discovered by the treasure revealer Orgyen Lingpa (o rgyan gling pa; b. 1323), his date thus providing a terminus ante quem for the original temple. The relevant account is found in canto 62, recording the completion of Samy&eacute; Monastery, and is translated as follows (with explanatory additions in square brackets):</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Lobo [= Mustang], the place which is as if a rakṣasī [a demoness] were lying on her back,</p>

<p>place on her heart a monastery with nine floors,</p>

<p>a stupa on her navel,</p>

<p>another small and black one on her head,</p>

<p>and one hundred and eight on her four limbs!</p>

<p>In Malgro is the naga king called Shines in Malgro [= mal gro gzi can ].</p>

<p>He has great influence in Tibet;</p>

<p>I will establish for him a naga treasure; I want his life philtre [= srog chu - life water].&quot;</p>

<p>And the Guru came along into Malgro.</p>

<p>Keeping his promise, shaking the depths, giving solid explanations,</p>

<p>and having given treasure and a place of worship for the nagas, he received the life philtre.</p>

<p>However, no oath bound the mind of the nagas, so to keep them silent,</p>

<p>he erected at Lobo the monastery of White Virtue [= dge dkar, Gekar].&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, Lo Gekhar is this monastery of White Virtue, and the surrounding ch&ouml;rten and springs are part of the holy site. This account also explains why Lo Gekhar is of great cultural and religious importance to the Mustang region and to Tibetan Buddhism at large. The temple is frequently visited by pilgrims from the region and beyond.</p>
