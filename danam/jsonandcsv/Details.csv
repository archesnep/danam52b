During this event, the Bhīmasena and four other statues kept in the sanctum are carried to the abovementioned <em>phalcā</em>. The sanctum of the temple remains empty for this period, therefore another statue of Bhīmasena (KAT0920-002), established in the northern side of the sanctum, is worshipped. This event is organized jointly by the members of various castes. The Citrakāra caste members paint the statues, and the Mānandharas secure the temple, wash the feet of Draupādī, decorate her, and bring the statue of Bhīmasena out from the sanctum. Since Bhīmasena himself is considered a Jyāpū (Maharjana), no other caste members are allowed to touch him. The Sthāpitas manage the wooden elements needed for the event, and the Tāmrākāras make the feet of Bhīmasena. Similarly, the Śākyas repair the mud made Bhīmasena statue, and the Vajrācāryas perform the rituals. The Kapālīs play music, especially <em>nagarā,</em>&nbsp;when the rituals are being performed.</p>

They placed the image to one side and continued their work. When they finished construction, the delighted Nānyadeva asked Suvarṇakīrti what he wished. Suvarṇakīrti asked for the excavated Buddha image, and the king gave it to him. Upon returning to Lalitpur, the artists and architects arranged a general assembly to decide what to do with the statue. Following&nbsp;the decision made by those assembled,&nbsp;they constructed a&nbsp;<em>vihāra</em>&nbsp;near to the pond at the western side of Lalitpur. The name of the monastic building was derived from the name of the group&#39;s leader, becoming&nbsp;Suvarṇakīrtisaṃskārita Śrivacchamahāvihāra.

In NS 783 and together with the workers who had worked on the construction of the <em>bāhāḥ</em>, the founder of the monastry&nbsp;Jothāju&nbsp;helped King Śrīnivāsa Malla in the process of extending&nbsp;the palace building.

Jothāju sold the horse and used the money to&nbsp;buy land. The land was named Salakhvāḥ Bũ. Using the income from this field,&nbsp;Jothāju also established a&nbsp;<em>guṭhī</em>&nbsp;for the management of Rudravarṇa Mahāvihāra.</p>

After this, only the&nbsp;people from the&nbsp;Jośī and Lavaḥ community were left to participate in the rituals. Nowadays, only Rājopādhyāyas conduct these ritual worships. After conquering Kathmandu Valley, Pṛthvīnārāyaṇa Śāha appointed new priests for Taleju, taking the responsibility for this away&nbsp;from the local people.

<p>1. Nitya Pūjā (daily ritual worship): The daily ritual worship is performed every morning and an&nbsp;<em>āratī</em>&nbsp;is offered to goddess Taleju&nbsp;in the evening. The Rajopadhyas are not given any allowance to perform this worship. The materials for the worship are provided by the Saṃsthāna&nbsp;<em>Guthī,&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;an added allowance of Rs 500 per month. A Jyāpu helper is regularly&nbsp;assigned to clean the temple and fetch water. This helper is chosen on the day of Dhānya Purṇimā (dark fortnight of Maṅsīra) from a Jyāpu community who celebrate&nbsp;Devālī. A land of 142-02-01 <em>ropanis</em> has been allocated for the Nitya Pūjā (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/IG45HARK/q/guthi"" target=""_blank""><strong>Guṭhī Saṃsthāna</strong></a> 2071, 46). Previously, <em>nagāras </em>were played in the morning and evening during the daily ritual worship by people simultaneously ringing the large bell. Kapālīs were assigned to play the <em>nagāra</em> and a land of 23-08-03 <em>ropanis</em> was allocated for this (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/IG45HARK/q/guthi"" target=""_blank""><strong>Guṭhī Saṃsthāna</strong></a> 2071,44). However, the tradition of playing <em>nagāras </em>has now ended. &nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Thāpūjā: Thāpūjā is performed five times a year:</p>

<p>&nbsp; i) On the 8th&nbsp;day of the dark half of the Bhādra</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) On the 12th day of the bright half of the Āśvina</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) On the 8th day of the dark half of the Maṅsīra&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;iv) On the 14th day of the dark half of the Phālguṇa</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;During these four Thāpūjās the priest receives a gift of three <em>masā </em>of gold and silver.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;v) On the 9th day of the dark half of Pauṣa.&nbsp;This <em>pūjā </em>is also called Gwayamāru Thāpūjā. The priest is given an allowance of three <em>masā </em>of silver, with the funds coming from&nbsp;land of 27-04-0 <em>ropanī&nbsp;</em>(<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/IG45HARK/q/guthi"" target=""_blank""><strong>Guṭhī Saṃsthāna</strong></a> 2071, 46).</p>

<p>3. Caḥrhe Pūjā:&nbsp;This <em>pūjā </em>is performed on every&nbsp;fourteenth day (of bright and dark half) of every lunar month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.

<p>5. Dhavãchā Pūjā (Damanārohaṇa Pūjā): This <em>pūjā</em> is performed on the 8th day of the dark half of the Vaiśākha.&nbsp;Seven <em>ropanis</em> of land have been allocated as a <em>guṭhī</em> for the <em>pūjā</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Taleju Varṣavardhana Pūjā: The Varṣavardhana <em>pūjā </em>is organized on the 10 day of the bright&nbsp;half of Jyeṣṭha.&nbsp; Siddhinarsimha Malla established this&nbsp;Temple in NS 740 on this very day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;Kumārī Pūjā:&nbsp;On the 9th day of the dark half of Āśvina, the main Kumārī&nbsp;of Hakhaḥ&nbsp;Bāhāḥ&nbsp;is brought to the temple and worshipped. Taleju is a secret deity, and so&nbsp;generally people do not have the opportunity to see her. To solve this problem,&nbsp;the Kumāri (who is believed to be her physical manifestation) appears in front of people and is worshipped by the devotees.</p>

As a monk, he had to ask for alms following the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition in Samyak, Navadāna or Pañcadāna. Instead of asking for alms by himself, he prepared an image of Dīpaṅkara Buddha (Phūdyaḥ) to act as his representative and ask for alms. He would&nbsp;send Dīpaṅkara Buddha in at the end of ceremony.

People began to run&nbsp;away out of fear of him. Among them were seven Brahmins who came to the jungle of Lalitpur and hid from him. They planted the stick they had brought with them and slept on it. When they woke up the next morning they saw that the stick had changed form. They realised that the land was sacred and so constructed an&nbsp;<em>agnimaṭha </em>and took up residence there. The youngest of the seven Brahmins were taken by the people of Bu Bāḥāh to perform <em>pūjā</em> and <em>yaj&ntilde;as</em>. That is why a group of Brahmins are still present in Bu Bāḥāh. The Brahmins of Bu Bāḥāh and Agnimaṭha are related and they have a <em>guṭhī&nbsp;</em>called Dhaubaji Guṭhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

A&nbsp;few Brahmins&nbsp;vowed not to pursue any of these&nbsp;immoral paths and began to migrate away from the area. Among them were two brothers who took their belongings and headed off&nbsp;in search of a better place. They came to the place where Agnimaṭha (<a href=""https://nhdp-test.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/report/1e2335a0-f62a-11e9-a3c8-0242ac130002"" target=""_blank""><strong>LAL0280</strong></a>) is situated today. They established an Agnimaṭha and started performing&nbsp;<em>yaj&ntilde;as</em>. The younger brother gave the responsibility for the&nbsp;<em>maṭha&nbsp;</em>to his elder brother. He took the&nbsp;<em>praj&ntilde;apārāmitā</em>&nbsp;book written in golden&nbsp;<em>ra&ntilde;janā&nbsp;</em>script into the&nbsp;<em>maṭḥa&nbsp;</em>and went to Bu Bāḥaḥ&nbsp;(<strong><a href=""https://nhdp-test.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/report/7ee44ac8-f17a-11e9-8649-0242ac130002"">LAL0440</a></strong>) where&nbsp;he became a Buddhist monk.&nbsp;Later, the brothers wanted to create&nbsp;a symbol of their legacy and so they planted a banyan&nbsp;tree at their places of residence. The tree planted by the elder brother in Agnimaṭha is the Varuṇa tree, and the tree planted by the younger brother is located in the&nbsp;<em>digi&nbsp;</em>of the Bu Bāḥāh. According to this legend, the Brahmin brothers&nbsp;came from Hāḍigāũ, established the Agnimaṭha and&nbsp;Bu Bāḥāh.</p>

On the next day, both deities are placed on cots and a procession starts. The statues of the deities are returned to the Manakāmanā temple at&nbsp;midday on&nbsp;the 11th day,</p>

<p>A legend related to these three deities is popular in Bungamati and tells that&nbsp;Āju (Lundekunde) and Ajimā are a couple. One evening, Āju did not return home. Ajimā walked all over the place looking for&nbsp;her husband and eventually arrived in Gorkha. Hayagrīva Bhaira found her there and asked her to return to Bungamati. He then&nbsp;took her to his house. After some days, Āju returned home, but could not find his wife. Later, he discovered that Hayagrīva had taken his wife to his house, and headed to&nbsp;Hayagrīva&rsquo;s house himself. However, Hayagrīva did not allow Āju to enter. This legend explains the tradition of the procession.</p>

The procession normally starts here, but&nbsp;starts from Bungmati every 12th year. The chariot remains in Pulchok for three days. On the fourth day, it is pulled as far as Gā Bāhāḥ. On the same day, the chariot of Mīnanātha is brought up to Pulchok to greet Buṅgadyaḥ. In the medieval period, the kings and their families used to come to watch the procession. At that time, dramas were also performed during the festival. In 1337, Jayata composed a drama called <em>Mahīrāvaṇavadha</em> to perform at the festival (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/SBZ6AHB7"" target=""_blank""><strong>J.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Nepal</strong></a>,&nbsp;VS 2040,&nbsp;20,32). Kings, elites and merchants would make&nbsp;various precious offerings to the deity during the procession. Many legends in the Newar community are linked in some way to this festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chariot mainly stops in four places: Ga Bahal, Sundhara, Lagankhel and Jawakhel. Locals of the area invite their relatives to come and celebrate&nbsp;when the chariot arrives at&nbsp;their locality. There are many events and worships connected to the chariot procession. The main&nbsp;worships among these are&nbsp;Ghaḥcāḥpūjā, Baupūjā, Kṣamāpūjā, Āpata-Vipatapūjā, Bautaygupūjā and Lasatāpūjā.</p>

On the day of this occasion, a fire sacrifice used to be performed in front of the temple, while a he-sheep was being sacrificed at the northern corner of the temple. In the sequel of these sacrificial&nbsp;rituals, the blood of the sacrificed he-sheep was mixed with rice, cooked, and offered&nbsp;to several other temples in Kirtipur followed by a procession with traditional music.<br />
<br />
Local residents still believe that whoever&nbsp;consumes this rice cooked with sacrificial blood, becomes healthier. The rice procession was followed by a feast. The Guṭhī Saṃsthāna (the central office administering the <em>guṭhīs</em>) continues to partially sponsor&nbsp;the procession, however, it is organised in a much smaller scale in present-day by some youths from the Jyāpu castes since the Guṭhī related to this temple (which was responsible for such events) does not exist anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;After the completion of the courtyard, one night King Śrīnivāsa Malla was told by a divine voice in his dream: &#39;&#39;Oh King, I&#39;m very pleased with this beautiful courtyard in a unique architectural style. The twin temples upon the roofs of the buildings are very impressive. The paved courtyard is magnificent. It looks like an amphitheatre for dance performances and entertainment.&#39;&#39; Then deities with colourful masks and costumes appeared and displayed their artistic skills in a most attractive way. When the king awoke, he was puzzled and could not believe it as a mere dream. It looked so real. Later, he held consultations with the royal astrologers and all of them thought it was an auspicious dream. Then King Śrīnivāsa Malla instituted an ensemble of mask ballet and staged it at this courtyard. He himself composed the music while the experts did the necessary choreography. The ensemble was named G&atilde; pyakh&atilde; and performed by artists from different fields. Since then every year during the Dasain festival, the mask dance is staged at this courtyard.&quot; (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/84ZADZE7/q/joshi"" target=""_blank""><strong>Jośī</strong></a>&nbsp;2003,&nbsp;26-27)</p>

After the feast, they present the&nbsp;liquour to the deity and express&nbsp;their gratitude for how strong and delicious the deity has made it. This worship is called <em>pakanāḥ</em>. A similar tradition exists in the Gaṇeśa temple of Pakanājol, Kathmandu and Sallaghari, Bhaktapur. In&nbsp;Kathmandu, people&nbsp;offer liquour&nbsp;at Pakanājol Gaṇeśa whilst in&nbsp;Bhaktapur they go to Cvaṅgā Gaṇeśa.</p>

Though the&nbsp;instruments were buried under the rubble, they were salvaged and&nbsp;documented by Kathmandu University art student Sameer Tamrakar. The small display of photographs of these instruments was meant to remind visitors to Photo Kathmandu of the importance of <em>phalcā</em> for intangible heritage (such as <em>bhajana&nbsp;</em>performances).

During the&nbsp;Satyayuga, King Sarvānanda was ruling over the Dīpāvatī city (Guitaḥ). One day, the king asked Dīpaṅkara Tathāgata to give alms to all the monks of the Tathāgata&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>gaṅgha</em>. An&nbsp;old woman also came to offer alms to the monks. The Dīpaṅkara Buddha was there,&nbsp;and chose to&nbsp;take alms from&nbsp;this old woman first. The king was surprised and asked the Buddha why he went to the old women before coming to the king.&nbsp;Buddha replied that it was because the old woman had earned these grains with great pain,&nbsp;and the wealth that king had accumulated had not taken&nbsp;much effort at all. Afterwards, the king went to live and work in a blacksmith&rsquo;s house&nbsp;and accrued some wealth. He again employed Dīpaṅkara to offer alms on the 8th day of the bright half of Śrāvaṇa.&nbsp;This time, when the Buddha appeared he&nbsp;received his offerings first. The king then established an image of Dīpaṅkara in his palace and constructed a&nbsp;<em>caitya</em>&nbsp;in front of it. The <em>caitya</em> was named Dīpāvatī Mahāvihāra. It was on this day that the tradition of offering <em>pa&ntilde;cadāna</em> to the&nbsp;<em>saṅgha</em>&nbsp;monks began.&nbsp;</p>

The chariots of Gaṇeśa, Mahādeva and Bālakumārī cannot be placed on the ground after the procession starts, and so&nbsp;people must carry them for hours. The sandalwood icons are stored on the first floor of Dyaḥ Sataḥ Phalcā. The day before the procession starts (i.e., 14th of the bright fortnight of Caitra), a pole (<em>yaḥsi</em>) which symbolises<em> </em>the Bhṛṅgāreśvara-<em>liṅga</em> is erected and stands for three days before being taken down again. Local residents send formal invitations to their relatives, friends and daughters to attend the the procession.</p>

<p>This festival is connected to the temple, and the town of Sunaguthi village is called Bālakumārī jātrā or Pyakhaḥ jātrā.&nbsp;In the Newari language, &#39;Pyakhaḥ&#39; means &#39;four palanquins&#39;.

<p>There was no direct protest against the governments&#39; plan of road widening and urban planning during the Sunaguthi Balkumari Jatra in March, 2018, but people were more conscious in this regard. The street was not officially blocked off during the three days, but Sunaguthi citizens&nbsp;constructed a&nbsp;bamboo obstacle at both ends of the road while the festival was going on. After consulting with the local traffic police officers, they arranged for an alternative road to be used by traffic&nbsp;for the first and last days of the festival.</p>

<p>A legend related to these three deities is popular in Bungamati. According to this,&nbsp;Āju (Lundekunde) and Ajimā are a couple. One evening, Āju did not return home. Ajimā walked all over the place looking for&nbsp;her husband, until she&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;Gorkha, where&nbsp;Hayagrīva Bhairava found her. He asked her to return to Bungamati, and&nbsp;took her to his house. Some days later, Āju returned to his house, but could not find his wife. Later, he found out that Hayagrīva had taken his wife to his house. Upon learning this, Āju too went to Hayagrīva&rsquo;s house. However, Hayagrīva did not allow Āju to come in. This legend&nbsp;explains the roots&nbsp;of the procession.</p>

He would take his meals only after offering <em>pūjā&nbsp;</em>to Vajrayoginī. He died during a visit to a <em>stūpa </em>in Lagankhel. However, because he died so young&nbsp;Yamarāja (the god of death) revived him. Beginning his second life, he found that hell was exactly as described in the&nbsp;Guṇakāraṇḍavyūha scripture. Upon his revival, he consecrated a statue&nbsp;of Dharmarāja Lokeśvara and constructed&nbsp;a Yamāntaka Āgama. Afterwards, he left everything to his brother Bālārcanadeva and headed to Bande village near&nbsp;Godawari. There,&nbsp;he consecrated a statue of the Five Buddhas and passed away. Balārcanadeva named the statue of Lokeśvara&nbsp;Jaṭādhārī&nbsp;Mīnanātha and took on the responsibility for its&nbsp;daily worship.</p>

<p>Even though the <em>pūjā&nbsp;</em>was performed&nbsp;regularly,&nbsp;Matikva Bhairava became angry one day. He took the form of a cat and killed a lot of children. The subjects of Bālārcana&#39;s kingdom were distressed. King Bālārcana took the statue of&nbsp;Jaṭādhārī&nbsp;Minanātha&nbsp;to Cakravarṇa Mahāvihāra and installed it there. He began living at the <em>vihāra</em>. After a few days, Mīnanātha&nbsp;Lokeśvara appeared in his dreams and told him that he did not like this new place. He informed the king that&nbsp;a sparrow would appear in the morning and guide him to the place where he should build a <em>vihāra </em>for him. In the next morning the king went to the terrace and saw a sparrow flying north towards a field. He consulted with his astrologers and organised the construction of a temple with a <em>vihāra,&nbsp;</em>where he&nbsp;consecrated the statue of Lokeśvara. Later on, the <em>vihāra</em> became known as Jyeṣṭhavarṇa Māhāvihāra. Since a sparrow (<em>cakhuṃcā </em>in Newari) guided the king to the current location of the&nbsp;<em>vihāra</em>, it is now called Cakhuṃ&nbsp;Bāhāḥ, Cāku Bāhāḥ&nbsp;or Chākbāḥdyaḥ.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

A&nbsp;few Brahmins&nbsp;vowed not to pursue any of these&nbsp;immoral paths and began to migrate away from the area. Among them were two brothers who took their belongings and headed off&nbsp;in search of a better place. They came to the place where Agnimaṭha (<a href=""https://nhdp-test.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/report/1e2335a0-f62a-11e9-a3c8-0242ac130002"" target=""_blank""><strong>LAL0280</strong></a>) is situated today. They established an Agnimaṭha and started performing&nbsp;<em>yaj&ntilde;a</em>. The younger brother gave the responsibility for the&nbsp;<em>maṭha&nbsp;</em>to his elder brother. He took the&nbsp;<em>praj&ntilde;apārāmitā</em>&nbsp;book written in golden&nbsp;<em>ra&ntilde;janā&nbsp;</em>script into the&nbsp;<em>maṭḥa&nbsp;</em>and went to Bu Bāḥaḥ&nbsp;where&nbsp;he became a Buddhist monk.&nbsp;Later, the brothers wanted to create&nbsp;a symbol of their legacy and so they planted a banyan&nbsp;tree at their places of residence. The tree planted by the elder brother in Agnimaṭha is the Varuṇa tree, and the tree planted by the younger brother is located in the&nbsp;<em>digi&nbsp;</em>of the Bu Bāḥāh. According to this legend, the Brahmin brothers&nbsp;came from Hāḍigāũ, established the Agnimaṭha and&nbsp;Bu Bāḥāh.</p>

A member from each house used to be sacrificed for the welfare of the village each year. One year, it was the turn of an old couple to prepare for the self-sacrifice. That time, a&nbsp;prince came to their house, seeking shelter. The couple offered it to him for the night and it is then when he learned that one of them was getting ready to be sacrificed to the&nbsp;demon. The prince requested the couple to let him go instead. They did not know that he was not a prince but the Goddess Indryaṇī&nbsp;in disguise. The elderly couple agreed and the prince went into the jungle. Upon encountering the demon, the prince killed him.</p>

<p>The festival is celebrated until today to remember the Goddesses victory. Lākhaypāḥ Phalcā is said to be the place where the sacrifices nomally took place. During the festival, an elderly person still comes there to wait for the demon (&#39;<em>lākhaypāḥ cvanegu&#39;</em>). The Phalcā is&nbsp;named as Lākhaypāḥ Phalcā&nbsp;after the name of this tradition. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For the ritual itself, a large copper vessel filled with rice wine is put up in front of Lākhaypāḥ Phalcā (2019 CE). Additionally, other food items are prepared and kept on clay plates next to the vessel. The food is symbolically offered to the <em>lakhe</em>. The vessel is later carried along with the Indryaṇī&rsquo;s palanquin on the procession route. The procession concludes in the Baghbhairava Temple Complex. There, the rice wine is offered to the devotees as <em>prasāda</em> (sacred food).</p>

If a ward seeks to renovate or reconstruct a building, they must apply to the municipality for funding. However, two major conditions of a successful application are that 1) the&nbsp;building (e.g. this&nbsp;Phalcā) must be reconstructed in a &#39;traditional&#39; style and 2) it must not be privatised (or commercialised, e.g. encroached upon by a shop). In this case, the municipality provided the necessary funds and the reconstruction work began. Some donors donated statues of deities that mentioned their names in the inscriptions; in total, four of these were installed. However, the municipality understood these inscriptions to be &#39;personalised&#39; or &#39;privatised&#39; and so halted the flow of money. The inscriptions were removed in August and September, and the community is now&nbsp;waiting for their funding to return so that the reconstruction may continue (writing in October, 2019).&nbsp;</p>

The deity was brought to Patan by the priest Kulāpāda Ācārya during the reign of King Bhāṣkaradeva Varman. Once it was brought to Patan, the deity was initially placed at Nyākhācuka until Bhāṣkaradeva built a new Vihāra (Nhū Bāhāḥ) for him. He was later moved to his current location at Hiraṇyavarṇa Mahāvihāra (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/AXQGR2E4""><strong>Śākya</strong></a>&nbsp;NS 1112,&nbsp;2-4).

<p>In their report on the <em>yatra</em>,&nbsp;Maharjan and Tandukar&nbsp;write: &quot;On the second day, the full moon day (Caitra Pūrṇīmā) the three wooden gods of Mahādeva, Kumāra, and Ganeśa made of special wood Śrikhaṇḍa is brought down from the <em>dyaḥchẽ</em> and installed on the wooden palanquins placed on the cleaned ground in front of the Tāhā Phalcā facing east direction. After a ritual performance and different musical groups like Dhime, Dāphā, khī̃ and <em>bāsurī</em> with the Kā̃ bājā the main deity of Bālakumārī is taken down from the main sanctum to the Palanquin placed on the central <em>dabū</em> of the Capāphaḥ hovered by a traditional screen overhead with the paintings of the Śākta family. The process is observed by thousands of locals by lighting the butter lamps on the open space. The palanquin is then carried by the young people to Dyaḥkhyaḥ (Bāla Kumārī Pig&atilde;) before the dusk.&quot; (p 2)</p>

<p>The heritage architects further write that &quot;The Bālakumārī is offered with sacrifice of a duck and <em>samaybaji</em> is distributed&quot;&nbsp;(ibid.), and&nbsp;&quot;on the third day after midnight the palanquin of Bālakumārī is taken back to the settlement with the playing of Kā̃ bājā and is welcomed by the three palanquins of Mahādeva, Kumāra, and Ganeśa near the ancient gate of the settlement. This place near the Dhvākā is called Dhvākāpine. The palanquin of Bālakumārī is circumambulated by the three other palanquins with immense joy of their reunion. Locals offer water to the carriers with joy at the midnight. After three rounds of circumambulation the palanquins are taken in front of the Tāhā Phalcā. This time the&nbsp;palanquin of the Bālakumārī is placed near the Phalcā to its side of the street and offered a sacrifice of a duck. The Nāyāmāḥ group rest on the Phalcā and the guthiyār offers them the <em>samaybajī</em> on a big brass vessel. The <em>samaybajī</em> is distributed to the local viewers also. The guthiyārs are given the special garland and greet each other with joy as a completion of one stage of the festival.

The argument was that the &#39;western&#39; artist had been ignoring, and thus also been disrespectful towards, the ancient and Indigenous craftsmanship and heritage of Nepal bydegrading it to &#39;slum art&#39;. However, many Nepali voices claimed that Nepalis also do not show proper respect for their cultural heritage and often allow it to deteriorate(Thapa 2014).

A famous myth is that a bull was once grazing in Nāga Bāhāḥ. At this time, a Dīpaṅkara Buddha visited Nāga Bāhāḥ and the bull roared, thus heralding the arrival of the Buddha. From that time onwards, whenever the bull roars, people came to attend the <em>Dipaṅkara Yātrā</em>. Allegedly, so another version of this, only a person with 32 special qualities (बत्तीस लक्षण यु्क्त), like the living goddess Kumārī, can hear the bull&#39;s roar, and when that happens, <em>Dipaṅkhā Yātrā</em> must be organised. The local community organises this <em>yātrā </em>at irregular intervals (the last time was in VS 2062/ 2008 CE (<a href=""https://www.zotero.org/groups/2247442/nhdp-bibliography/items/itemKey/UTZD7IHB/q/Michaels"" target=""_blank""><strong>Michaels</strong></a> 2013)). It took place on 17 October 2005 (Monday, Ashwin 31, 2062 B.S.) after 38 years of rest. An estimated 100,000 people participated in the journey. The most recent <em>Dipaṅkhā Yātrā</em> was organized on 18 October 2013 (Friday, Kārtik 1, 2070).</p>

<p>The <em>Itilane samyak</em> festival (<em>parva</em>) is organised every 4 years during the month of <em>Phālgun </em> (February/March)<em>.</em> More than 200 Dipaṅkara Buddha statues are carried from various monasteries in the Valley to Nāga Bahā and worshipped for a day.</p>

<p>There is a tradition of feasting after the special <em>pūja</em> in<em> guṁlā sukla da</em>ś<em>amī</em>, which is organised by the priest of Paśuvarṇa Mahāvihāra, and of making and exhibiting of <em>lucidyaḥ</em> (Buddha statues made of mud) on the day of <em>guṁlā punhiṁ </em>(the full moon of the month of <em>Bhādra</em>).</p>

<p>The Śākyamuni Buddha statue is said to have been installed in the main sanctumby Tibetan <em>lāmas</em>. The inscription next to the main shrine is in Tibetan and Newāri script, but unfortunately it is badly damaged.</p>

<p>L:&nbsp;This one (<em>Sanāḥ</em> <em>Guthi</em> <em>Chẽ</em>) was just a one-floor <em>phalcā</em>. There used to be a low attic-like space on the upper floor. It had tile roof. There was not enough space for all the <em>guthiyārs </em>(members of the <em>guthi</em>) due to growing population. So, the seniors then collected Rs. 4,000 per <em>bhutūpvāḥ </em>(kitchen). I don&#39;t know if you understand the clause of &#39;per <em>bhutūpvaḥ</em>&#39;. Let&#39;s say, he is my son and he has separated from me. He has his own separate kitchen. So, his kitchen is also counted. That&rsquo;s it. They collected money based on the number of kitchens we had in the community back then to rebuild the <em>guthi</em> <em>chẽ</em>. In doing so, they managed to accumulate about Rs. 2,000,000 altogether.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;Oh, that means there were a lot of members.</p>

<p>L: Yes, there were.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;Do you remember any games that you used to play here?</p>

(It was in front of the <em>guthi</em> <em>chẽ</em>) It was a one-story building then. They used to dump the ashes obtained from burning straws in the kitchen there. The water drained out after mixing it with such ashes is very good for washing clothes. It economized the use of soap. So, lines are drawn on the ground using the ashes so as to make squares. There are six players; there are the ones who try obstruct and stop, and the runners try to pass by them without being tapped. After the runners cross the mark, they cry out &#39;<em>cvalay</em>, <em>cvalay</em>&#39;. We used to play that game a lot here.

Because you don&rsquo;t find that sort of (designs on the) pillars in the <em>phalcā</em>s. The size of the pillars was also not correct. The size of the pillars was very small, which was the main mistake. Hence, I changed the size of the pillars, along with the designs. Originally, the Phalcā was of only one floor. But at the time of the reconstruction, they raised an additional floor as they needed more space. If it was just one floor, the pillars would have to bear the load of the roof only. But now it has an additional floor. That&rsquo;s why the size of the pillars was also not enough.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also changed the designs of the pillar. What is the source of the concept of your designs? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have been involved in this field for quite a long time, I have the experience regarding the kind of pillars and designs that are found in <em>phalcā</em>s. (On the basis) of the same experience, (I can tell that) the designs on the pillars installed there were only introduced later. Those were not the kind of pillars that you would find in <em>phalcā</em>s. The pillars that we usually find in <em>phalcā</em>s are the ones with the kind of designs that I made. It is one of the older designs.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the designs of the <em>phalcā</em> pillars, there are designs called <em>myaemikhā</em> (buffalo&rsquo;s eye). Over it, there is <em>khvaḥsiṃgvaḥ</em> (walnut) designs.</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it is called <em>khvaḥsiṃgvaḥ</em> and also <em>ambasāhā</em> too.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, and there is the <em>sãkuli</em> (curl of hair) designs as well. Why do we have such designs?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>sãkuli </em>design is said to be the symbol of Bhairava because only the Bhairava has a curl of hair like these. You should notice it, in any drawings, if one needs to show the hairs of <em>Bhairava</em> then that design is used.</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in this pillar<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>, too, we have almost all the designs that are usually found in <em>phalcā</em>s. And (<em>pointing to the simple semi-circular line carvings just below the upper part with main carvings end</em>) this is also an old design. &nbsp;</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have that design in the pillars of the Cabahal Phalcā too, right?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it is in the Cabahal Phalcā pillars too. This is a very old design. If we look at the pillars of the Licchavi period, they don&rsquo;t have many designs. They have less details. The newer the pillars are, the more details they have.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the Cabahal Phalcā pillars is an old one, right?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is an old design. I used the old design.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the <em>myaemikhā</em> (buffalo&rsquo;s eye) symbolize?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much about this. All the carpenters call it <em>myaemikhā</em>. In fact, it does look like a buffalo&rsquo;s eye. But I don&rsquo;t really know the meaning of it.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we have to have these designs in a pillar?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, these are a kind of requirement of a pillar. If we use new designs on a pillar, I think they don&rsquo;t look nice. There is no point in introducing new designs while claiming to re/build in a traditional way. These (pillars and the carvings) will remain for years and years. If anyone comes for any research, how can one claim the Phalcā to be old when it has pillars with new designs? So, I think it is an old monument, it should contain old designs. Otherwise, it is better to make new ones and simply say that these are new ones. We have many new constructions being carried out in our place these days. They claim that it is traditional but carelessly employ all kinds of designs. They don&rsquo;t really care about the designs. They just want to make it look attractive.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always wanted to know why do we need to have these designs. For instance, there are pillars with a <em>kalaśa</em> motif in a pillar. Usually, a <em>kalaśa</em> is a symbol of water. I think there should be some philosophical background. We no longer understand this now.</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were never told about these (by our ancestors) and there aren&rsquo;t any written sources that explain about these motifs. Regarding the <em>kalaśa</em> motif, if you look at some of the <em>Licchavi</em> stūpas (<em>caityas</em>), for instance, the <em>caitya</em> of Dhwakhabahal (in Kathmandu), also has pillars on two sides that contain the <em>kalaśa</em> motif. That design belongs to the Gupta period in India and Licchavi period here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it important to keep the <em>phalcā</em>s alive? Can&rsquo;t we just remove them? They are just occupying the space and appear to be not in use anymore.</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if these <em>phalcā</em>s cease to exist, the identity of the Newars will also cease to exist. Because we have <em>dāphā bhajanas</em>. There are <em>jātrās </em>and people need to stay there during <em>jātrā</em>s. We need to preserve them for that too. There aren&rsquo;t many <em>phalcā</em>s in Kathmandu anymore. If anyone goes there and has to stay for a while when it rains, then there is no place. Either one has to take shelter under the eaves of any roof. So, in the Newar settlements, the <em>phalcā</em>s are necessary for <em>jātrā</em>s and <em>dāphā</em> <em>bhajan</em>s.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mean, the Newars have a certain lifestyle and the <em>phalcā</em>s are related to that?</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is related to that.</p>

<p>RS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is not just an architectural structure.</p>

<p>BB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it is not. Religious aspects are also attached to it. Some people also perform the <em>busādhaṃ<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2""><strong>[2]</strong></a></em> pūjā at the <em>phalcā</em> once a year. In Bhaktapur, people distribute some food items when they perform the <em>busādhaṃ</em> pūjā at any <em>phalcā</em>. That tradition is still there mostly in case of the <em>phalcā</em>s with its donors still active. The members of the <em>guthi</em> come and perform the <em>pūjā</em>, have <em>samay<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3""><strong>[3]</strong></a></em> and distribute <em>samay</em> to people around the area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>R: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the situation here after the earthquake?</p>

<p>K: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the gate wasn&#39;t there, the <em>phalcā</em> would have collapsed too. Wooden supports have been placed. We are scared to stay in there. After the earthquake, some people have brought their personal belongings to put in there. So, the performance of the <em>bhajans</em> has been interrupted. There is no other place to perform the <em>bhajan</em>. We are performing <em>bhajans</em> on <em>saṃlhū </em>and <em>pūnhi</em> in front of <em>Bungadyaḥ</em>. We have to perform the <em>bhajans</em>, but, unfortunately, we don&#39;t have any space to do so (the open space in the courtyard was also covered by tents with people living in them). Besides the <em>bhajan </em>of the <em>ṭol</em>, I have been involved in the <em>Karuṇāmaya Bhajan </em>and <em>Nasaṃcā Dāphā Bhajan</em>, which is being performed since ages.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>R: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t you feel like something missing in life since you are not able to perform the <em>bhajans</em>?</p>

<p>K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no way I can explain how true that is. But since the earthquake, there has been earthquakes in the mind too. I must say all my strength has gone. If I go upstairs alone, I get scared that there may be an earthquake. I get startled even if a cat jumps. It (fear) has already gripped my heart due to the earthquake. It feels like my heart has been eaten by insects. I just cannot stay alone. If there are others around, then the mind gets diverted a bit. At least, one tends to forget about all these things.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do the other gentlemen that we met that morning say about the discontinuation of the <em>bhajans</em>?</p>

<p>K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, they say that the situation did not permit us to perform <em>bhajanas. </em>Otherwise, the performance of the <em>bhajana</em> used to begin after observing the <em>nhawaṃ (</em>Ritual bathing of <em>Karuṇāmaya</em> or <em>Buṅgadyaḥ</em> held at the platform under the big tree known as <em>Māṃ Simā</em> in Lagankhel) ritual of <em>Karuṇāmaya</em>. We go all the way to Bunga to perform <em>bhajanas. </em>It used to continue until the <em>jātrā </em>was over and the idol reached back to Bunga. We are not required to go there after the deity is dethroned from the chariot and taken to Bunga. We have such system here.</p>",0,,fb0a49c4-b8f7-11e9-b8a9-0242ac120007

At the time of Ya&ntilde;nyā Punhi, a senior member of the Guṭhī says that members&nbsp;&quot;have to play the music and parade goddess Bālakumārī (a statue) to the Bāhāla, and house her there. We play the Duba Khee&ntilde;, we perform Bhajan.&quot; (3.11.2016, interview by Sanjeep Maharjan)</p>

<p>The reconstruction of the Phalcā was important for senior citizens, who feared that the tradition of <em>bhajana</em>&nbsp;chanting would come to an end without hte monument to house these recitals.&nbsp;They are already worried about a lack of interest in the younger generation; as&nbsp;Mr Maharjan puts it,&nbsp;&quot;they are not teaching, what to do? Nowadays nobody is interested. No one likes to do the <em>bhajana</em>. At old times, during the <em>jātrā </em>at Karuṇāmaya&rsquo;s, each Ṭola has to come to perform <em>bhajana </em>there, Khee&ntilde; Bhajana. No one comes now. People have stopped attending. We have been performing there though.&quot; (ibid)</p>

<p>Local musicians come together every morning to play various Dāpha instruments and recite verses in harmony with the rhythm, particularly in praise of Karuṇāmaya, Bālakumāri and Bhagvāndyaḥ. Additionally, locals use the space for chanting of the venerated Buddhist text&nbsp;Nāmasaṅgīti (Nāmāsana). Two groups of Maharjans are involved in this, and they&nbsp;display&nbsp;a figure of Yamadyaḥ and Bhairava here on the occasion of <em>yanyāpunhi</em> whilst&nbsp;Bajrācāryas from Tabāhā distribute <em>samay</em>.</p>

<p>After the 2015 earthquakes, the Lũchẽ Nani Phalcā was so badly damaged that it could no longer be used. The <em>bhajana</em> group continued performing, not only because of their religious duty but also due to the group&#39;s&nbsp;eagerness to uphold tradition and to keep&nbsp;playing music. Whilst the Phalcā was out of use, the group&nbsp;moved to a provisionary space in the monastic building next door. This site&nbsp;was also badly damaged but still had some open space&nbsp;(see photograph).</p>

<p>The Bhajana group from here is important for the Buṅgadhyaḥ Jātrā, as it accompanies the chariot along its journey through Old Patan. It&nbsp;also performs&nbsp;<em>bhajana</em> every morning in the Matsyendranātha shrine during the several months that&nbsp;the statue of the Red Matsyendranath is kept there. They also perform daily <em>bhajans</em> in Lũchẽ Nani during the months of Gũlā (the 10th month of the Newar calendar, ca. July-Aug)&nbsp;and Māgha (10th month of the Vikrama Era, ca. Jan-Feb), as well as on&nbsp;auspicious days such as&nbsp;<em>aṣṭamī&nbsp;</em>(8th day), <em>pūnhi&nbsp;</em>(full-moon day) and&nbsp;<em>saṃlhū&nbsp;</em>(1st day of the solar calendar of the Vikrama Era). According to Kāji Bābu Maharjan, a local and regular attendant of the <em>bhajanas</em>, the Phalcā is now occupied by various belongings of nearby&nbsp;locals; their things are&nbsp;stored there because their houses are still in&nbsp;poor condition.</p>

<p><em>Bhajana</em> performances are an important&nbsp;intangible heritage of the locality and play a central role in&nbsp;major Newar rituals&nbsp;(see Social and Religious Activities). No deities are installed at the Phalcā, but a small idol of Nāmasaṅgīti is placed inside the monument&nbsp;when&nbsp;<em>bhajanas</em>&nbsp;are performed in the month&nbsp;of Māgha.</p>",Bhajana,Local knowledge,"<p>This is part of the extensive documentation conducted on intangible and tangible heritage in post-earthquake Patan from 2015-2017 through Heidelberg University.

<p>A resident of the nearby Sā͂lā, JL&nbsp;Shrestha (54 years old in 2018), states that the original donor of the&nbsp;Calakhu Bhairava Phalcā was Juju Sāhu (his ancestor from about eight&nbsp;generations ago). He&nbsp;built the Phalcā as a place to stay whilst away from his house&nbsp;for one night while returning&nbsp;from trading in&nbsp;Tibet. According to&nbsp;tradition, any person who left&nbsp;the country had to go through purification rites before he could&nbsp;enter his home upon his return. If he failed to do so, the whole house and its family members would be considered &#39;impure&#39; due to contamination. As performing this purificatory rite and getting a writ of&nbsp;<em>patiyā</em>&nbsp;(purification letter from Dharmadhikār) would take time, the transitional time was usually spent in a <em>phalcā</em>. According to Shrestha, his ancestors used to trade in Tibet and would&nbsp;bring&nbsp;goats back with them. That is why the whole clan is called &quot;Phai sāhu&quot; (goat merchant) or &quot;Sa͂y sāhu&quot; (Tibetan merchant).</p>

<p>According to senior citizen D Shrestha (66) of Sijabahā and Maysing Maharjan, the two western bays of the Calakhu Bhairava Phalcā&nbsp;are&nbsp;related to his ancestors. Until the generation of his father,&nbsp;D Shrestha&nbsp;had to go to the Phalcā to distribute <em>samayabaji</em> on the day of Indrajātrā. He states that only the three eastern bays of the Phalcā are connected to the Phai Sāhus of Sā͂lā.</p>

<p>D Shrestha remembers that a stone inscription declaring his ancestors&#39;&nbsp;ownership of Phalcā and Sataḥ was once attached to the backside of Calkhu Sataḥ. However, it has since been lost.</p>

<p>Today, Brahman-Chhetri and Tamang people from the hills still come to this&nbsp;Phalcā to sleep.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many&nbsp;<em>guthiyāras</em>&nbsp;(members of the&nbsp;<em>guthi</em>) related to the&nbsp;Phalcā&nbsp;are there along with you?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, about the&nbsp;<em>guthiyāras</em>, almost all the Shresthas from here (Calkhu Square) to down there (Sāṃla area) are the&nbsp;<em>guthiyāras</em>. (Pointing at Maesingh) They are the&nbsp;<em>pāḥlāḥs</em>&nbsp;(caretakers). They are the ones who take care of the&nbsp;Phalcā. We, the Shresthas, from here (eastern part of the Calkhu Square) to all the houses further east in Sāṃla area (are members of the&nbsp;<em>guthi</em>). You see that house (the concrete house opposite to the south-eastern corner of the Pimbahāl water tank)? That one was also a&nbsp;<em>phalcā</em>. It is said that one also belongs to us, but we did not really take much interest on it. Now, they are using it. The people who needed it are using it. That&#39;s more important. We could have disallowed (them) to stay. To the best of my knowledge, the&nbsp;Phalcā&nbsp;was given to the&nbsp;<em>Jogīs</em>. They come to collect (certain offerings, especially a complete set of dishes prepared for the feast, given in the name of the deceased) every time there is a&nbsp;<em>śrāddha</em>&nbsp;being performed at any house in the area. From what I&#39;ve heard, that&#39;s why they were brought to live there. Only god knows&hellip; even I don&#39;t exactly know all about this. It was a&nbsp;Phalcā&nbsp;with one floor on top. The ground floor was the&nbsp;Phalcā&nbsp;itself, with one floor on top of it for them to stay.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>V:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have to offer&nbsp;<em>jogībwa</em>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<em>Jogīs</em>&nbsp;when we perform&nbsp;<em>śrāddha</em>&nbsp;at our house. That&#39;s it. He used to come and collect it in this whole area. I&#39;m telling you the things that I was told (by my elders). Talking about such things these days will not be sensible. The status of the people has changed now. It is not right for us to talk like that these days.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the other&nbsp;<em>phalcā</em>&nbsp;(that belongs to you), do you have to display any image of god or perform pujas there?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, on the day of eating&nbsp;<em>samay</em>.</p>

<p>M:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not on the&nbsp;<em>phalcā</em>&nbsp;itself, but we have to perform puja for the deity.</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We only stay there and sleep in the&nbsp;<em>phalcā</em>. Once every year, on the day of eating&nbsp;<em>samay</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>M:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice a year. Once during&nbsp;<em>Mohani</em>&nbsp;festival too.</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we sleep there twice a year - once on the&nbsp;<em>Kojāgrata Pūrṇimā</em>, and once on the day we eat&nbsp;<em>samay</em>&nbsp;and display the image as well.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is on the day of&nbsp;<em>Pu&ntilde;cali Bhujā</em>, right?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which deity do you display on that day?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord&nbsp;<em>Ganeśa</em>.</p>

<p>M: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said to be the display of Lord&nbsp;<em>Ganeśa</em>, but actually it is the image of Lord&nbsp;<em>Bhairava</em>.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have to perform the&nbsp;<em>Hāthu Hāekegu</em>&nbsp;ritual too?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no.</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the tradition of displaying the images still continuing?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. Come to observe it on the (coming)&nbsp;<em>pūrṇimā</em>. Take a look at the deity today. On the&nbsp;<em>pūrṇimā</em>, there will be another image there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>R:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does your family display the image of Lord&nbsp;<em>Ganeśa</em>?</p>

<p>V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pointing to another elderly person) He does it. Now, the responsibility has come on to his shoulders. There were other&nbsp;<em>guthi</em>&nbsp;members too in the past. But now it has come down on to his sole responsibility. This is all I know.</p>

Despite searching far and wide, no appropriate person could be found to organise the reconstruction of the temple. As such, the king asked the&nbsp;architect leader&nbsp;to return. He first developed a miniature version, and then began to reconstruct the temple itself. Once his work was completed, the pleased king allowed him to return to live in Patan.
