Sometimes after that, possibly because of earthquake damage, the roof was removed and the upper parapet wall reduced in height by about 100 centimeters. The reconstructed roof shows a much reduced slope, and less timber was used than would have been traditional standard. A central dormer replaced the original two. Most likely the original roof cover was the typical terracotta tile laid in mud mortar. Today the roof is covered with large pan tiles.</p>

It stood as a plain base until the summer of 2019. The reconstruction efforts are&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;local help and municipality funding.</p>

<p>This suggests that there are a few examples of endangered sites (such as&nbsp;<em>phalcās</em>) that are valued by the local community enough for them to attempt to&nbsp;gather funds from the municipality and private donors in order to reconstruct them. In this case, as in others, it is noticable that traditional materials are being used to repair the building (rather than cement, as was popular in the 1990s and the early 2000s). It is also clear that&nbsp;when municipalities do choose to grant money&nbsp;the work is given to the cheapest contracter available. Often, this means that the work is of poor quality and cheap materials are used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can also be seen in the example of&nbsp;Kutisaugaḥ Phalcā; here, the crucial ventilation points between the planks and the brick/stone basement are missing. This means that in a few years time&nbsp;the dampness from the ground will likely damage the wood of the platform and the pillars. Moreover, the timber bought for the pillars is cheap. Sourced from Malaysia, this wood grows fast and breaks easily, in part because it is not given enough time to dry. The expensive alternative is sal-wood (from east or west Nepal); this grows slowly but is of higher quality. However, sal-wood has become very expensive since the earthquakes due to an increase in demand. Cheap timber could be used for the beams, but is not suitable for the pillars as these&nbsp;need to carry heavy weight. The carvings too have been completed hastily and have a rough appearance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, and although they mean well, contracters are often unaware of the intricacies of&nbsp;reconstructing historical monuments. This is a huge threat to cultural heritage. It also means that the buildings will require further renovation some time in the near future.</p>
